feat: Implement comprehensive school logo management and module refactoring

This commit introduces significant enhancements to the School module, enabling robust management of school logos via Spatie Media Library, and refactors core service logic.

Major Changes:
- **School Logo Management:**
  - `Modules\School\Models\School`: Updated `getLogoUrlAttribute` to correctly serve logo URLs.
  - `Modules\School\Services\SchoolService`: Refactored `create` and `update` methods to fully support `school_logo_file` uploads, including clearing old logos on update.
  - Introduced `Modules\School\Livewire\SchoolManager` and associated Blade view (`school-manager.blade.php`) for a dedicated UI to manage school details and logo uploads.
  - Implemented `Modules\School\Livewire\Forms\SchoolForm` for robust form handling in the SchoolManager.
- **Service Layer Enhancements:**
  - `Modules\Shared\Concerns\EloquentQuery`: Expanded with `first` and `updateOrCreate` methods, and made `create`/`update` protected for consistent service interaction. This significantly improves reusability and maintainability of service logic across modules.
  - `Modules\School\src\Contracts\Services\SchoolService`: Interface updated to reflect new service capabilities.
- **School Module Integration:**
  - `Modules\School\src\Providers\SchoolServiceProvider`: Registered `SchoolService` binding and added view slots for better modularity.
  - `Modules\School\database\migrations`: Made school `name` unique to prevent duplicates.

Minor Changes & Refactorings:
- **Dependency Updates:** Added `postare/blade-mdi` and `secondnetwork/blade-tabler-icons` to `composer.json`.
- **Livewire Components:**
  - `Modules\Department\Livewire\DepartmentManager` and `Modules\Internship\Livewire\InternshipManager`: Integrated `HandlesRecords` concern for standardized record management.
- **Media Module Testing:** Refactored `MediaTest.php` by moving dummy models to `Modules\Media\Tests\Dummies/`.
- **Setup Process Adjustments:**
  - `Modules\Setting\database\seeders\AppSettingSeeder`: Changed `app_installed` default to `false`.
  - `Modules\Setup\Livewire\SetupSchool`: Updated event listener from `school-updated` to `school-saved`.
  - `Modules\Setup\resources\views/`: Minor layout and text adjustments in setup wizard views.
  - `Modules\Setup\src\Services\SetupService`: Updated `brand_logo` and `brand_logo_dark` references to use `_url` attribute.
- **UI Components:** Introduced new Blade UI components: `file-upload`, `radio`, `select`, `textarea`.
- **Routing:** Changed default web route to redirect to login.
