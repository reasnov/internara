## 1. Our Pledge (ISO 26000 Alignment)

In the interest of fostering an open, welcoming, and strictly professional engineering environment,
we as contributors and maintainers pledge to make participation in our project a harassment-free
experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics,
gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality,
personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

We prioritize **Technical Merit** and **Professional Integrity** above all else.

Contributors are expected to adhere to the following behavioral standards:

### 2.1 Professional Discourse

- **Technical Focus**: Critique ideas and code, never people. Ad hominem attacks are strictly
  prohibited.
- **Constructive Feedback**: Feedback must be actionable, specific, and respectful. Use the "Request
  for Changes" mechanism to improve quality, not to demean.

  of others without explicit consent.

### 2.2 Community Integrity

- **Authenticity**: Represent yourself and your credentials honestly.
