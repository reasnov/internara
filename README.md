**Internara** is an open-source internship management system built with **Laravel 12**, **Livewire 3**, and a **Modular Monolith** architecture. It is designed to streamline the entire internship lifecycle, from registration and journal logging to final reporting and evaluation.

## Features

-   **Modular Architecture:** Built using `nwidart/laravel-modules` for a scalable and maintainable codebase, isolating business domains into self-contained modules.
-   **Modern Tech Stack:** Leveraging the **TALL Stack** (Tailwind CSS v4, Alpine.js, Laravel 12, Livewire 3) for a blazing-fast and interactive user experience.
-   **Robust Infrastructure:**
    -   **Automated DI:** Self-binding service layer using `EloquentQuery` patterns.
    -   **Modular Tooling:** Custom Artisan generators for Classes, Interfaces, and Traits that respect modular namespace conventions.
    -   **Standardized States:** Integrated status management across all domain models.
-   **Role-Based Access Control:** Secure access management using `spatie/laravel-permission` with full UUID support and modular isolation.
-   **Internship Lifecycle Management:**
    -   **Registration:** Students can browse and apply for available placements.
    -   **Journals:** Daily log entries for students to track their progress.
    -   **Assignments:** Teachers can assign tasks and review submissions.
    -   **Assessments:** Comprehensive evaluation system with customizable aspects and indicators.
    -   **Reporting:** Automated and manual reporting tools for final grades.
-   **Minimalist UI:** Designed with **MaryUI** and **DaisyUI** for a clean, professional, and accessible interface.
