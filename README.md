**Internara** is a comprehensive **Practical Work Management Information System (SIM-PKL)** designed
to modernize how educational institutions manage internships and vocational training programs.

Built to bridge the gap between academic administration and industrial practice, Internara provides
a centralized, digital ecosystem for managing the entire lifecycle of practical work—from initial
registration to final competency evaluation.
