## 🚀 Architectural Doctrine: The 3S Principles

Internara is governed by the **3S Doctrine**, ensuring it remains a high-fidelity engineering benchmark:

1.  **SECURE (S1)**: Rigorous RBAC, UUID identity, and PII encryption by default (ISO/IEC 27001 aligned).
2.  **SUSTAINABLE (S2)**: Strict typing, modular isolation, and comprehensive TDD (ISO/IEC 25010 aligned).
3.  **SCALABLE (S3)**: Contract-first inter-module communication and event-driven orchestration.
