## How to Read Our Version Notes

In this project, we prioritize **Engineering Stories** over simple checklists. Each version document
in `docs/versions/` contains:

1. **Problem Analysis:** The technical "Why" behind the release.
2. **Architectural Pillars:** The strategic "How".
3. **Deep-Dive Implementation:** Narrative of core logic and module interactions.
4. **Architectural Impact:** Analysis of how the system evolved.
