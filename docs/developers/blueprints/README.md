# Application Blueprints: Strategic Design Index

This index centralizes the **Architecture Design Records (ADR)** for the Internara project. Every
development series originates as a blueprint, providing the bridge between requirements and
technical implementation.

---

## 1. Governance & Standards

- **[Blueprint Design Guidelines](../blueprints.md)**: Standards for the elicitation and
  formalization of design intent.

## 2. Active & Planned Development Series

- **[13-ARC01-FIX-01 (Beta Preparation & Stabilization)](13-ARC01-FIX-01-Beta-Preparation.md)**
- **[08-ARC01-INTEL-01 (Reporting & Intelligence)](08-ARC01-INTEL-01-Reporting-Intelligence.md)**

---

## 3. Done Design Baselines

- **[12-ARC01-ORCH-02 (Timeline Transparency & Instructional Guidance)](12-ARC01-ORCH-02-Schedule-Guidance.md)**
- **[11-ARC01-GAP-02 (Instructional Execution, Mentoring & Evaluation)](11-ARC01-GAP-02-Instructional-Execution.md)**
- **[10-ARC01-GAP-01 (Integrative Excellence)](10-ARC01-GAP-01-Integrative-Excellence.md)**
- **[09-ARC01-BOOT-01 (System Initialization)](09-ARC01-BOOT-01-System-Initialization.md)**

---

## 4. Historical Design Archive

- **[Archived Blueprints Index](archived/README.md)**: Formal records of decommissioned
  or legacy designs.

---

_Once a design intent is successfully done, its blueprint is archived. The as-built outcome is
documented in the **[Release Baselines](../../pubs/releases/README.md)**, mapped via its
unique **Series Code**._
