## ⚖️ Governance

All blueprints in this directory must adhere to the standards defined in
**[Blueprint Guidelines](../blueprints.md)**.

- **Status**: Blueprints are living documents.
- **Traceability**: Every design must trace back to the **[System Specs](../specs.md)**.
- **Verification**: Milestone fulfillment requires a 100% verification pass.

_Design is the blueprint of stability; it governs the evolution of the Internara ecosystem._
