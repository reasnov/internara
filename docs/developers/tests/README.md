# Verification Records: Systematic Testing Index

This index centralizes the **Verification & Validation (V&V)** records for the Internara project,
consistent with **IEEE Std 1012**. It provides technical guidance for constructing and executing
deterministic verification artifacts.

## 1. Verification Philosophy

- **[Verification Philosophy](../testing.md)**: Engineering reliability and the Pest v4 baseline.

## 2. Specialized Verification Protocols

- **[Persistence Verification](database-testing.md)**: Standards for schema and model integrity.
- **[Presentation Verification](livewire-tests.md)**: Standards for interactive UI orchestration.
- **[Endpoint Verification](http-tests.md)**: Standards for boundary protection and API state.
- **[Infrastructure Verification](console-tests.md)**: Standards for CLI orchestration tools.
- **[Dependency Mocking](mocking.md)**: Protocols for strict modular isolation during V&V.

## 3. Pest v4 Technical Baseline

- **[Pest Documentation Index](pestphp/README.md)**: Comprehensive technical catalog for the Pest
  verification framework.
