# Pest v4 Is Here — Now with Browser Testing

Today, we're thrilled to announce the release of **Pest v4**, bringing the biggest testing upgrade
yet: powerful **[Browser Testing](/docs/browser-testing)**. Pest's new browser testing features let
you run elegant, maintainable browser tests — with first-class support for Laravel's testing API and
the ability to run tests in parallel. For the first time, this is browser testing that feels as good
as writing unit tests.

Here is the creator of Pest, [Nuno Maduro](https://twitter.com/enunomaduro), demoing the new browser
testing features in Pest v4 at Laracon US:

Here is an example of Browser Testing using [Laravel](https://laravel.com):

```php
test('may reset the password', function () {
    // access any laravel testing helpers...
    Notification::fake();

    // access to the database — using the RefreshDatabase trait (even sqlite in memory...)
    $this->actingAs(User::factory()->create());

    $page = visit('/sign-in') // visit on a real browser...
        ->on()
        ->mobile() // or ->desktop(), ->tablet(), etc...
        ->inDarkMode(); // or ->inLightMode()

    $page
        ->assertSee('Sign In')
        ->click('Forgot Password?')
        ->type('email', 'nuno@laravel.com')
        ->press('Send Reset Link')
        ->assertSee('We have emailed your password reset link!')
        ->assertNoJavascriptErrors(); // or ->assertNoConsoleLogs()

    Notification::assertSent(ResetPassword::class);
});
```

With Pest v4's browser testing, you can:

- Seamlessly use **Laravel features** like `Event::fake()`, `assertAuthenticated()`, and model
  factories
- Use `RefreshDatabase`, even with SQLite in-memory databases, to ensure a clean state for each test
- Test on **multiple browsers** (Chrome, Firefox, Safari)
- Test on **different devices** and viewports (like iPhone 14 Pro, tablets, or custom breakpoints)
- Switch **color schemes** (light/dark mode)
- Interact with the page (click, type, scroll, select, submit, drag-and-drop, touch gestures, etc.)
- Run **parallel browser tests** for dramatically faster suites
- Take **screenshots** or pause tests for debugging
- …all with the elegance of Pest syntax
- **Playwright-based** — modern, fast, and reliable

To get started with browser testing in Pest, you need to install the Pest Browser Plugin:

```bash
composer require pestphp/pest-plugin-browser --dev

npm install playwright@latest
npx playwright install
```

After, you may use the `visit()` function anywhere. Finally, running this test is as simple as
executing `./vendor/bin/pest` in your terminal. Pest will handle the rest, launching a browser,
navigating to the page, and performing the actions you specified.

## Smoke Testing

Smoke testing your application in real browsers has never been easier. With Pest v4, you can
literally visit all your application pages, and ensure they don't throw any JavaScript errors, and
they don't log any console errors.

```php
$routes = ['/', '/about', '/contact'];

visit($routes)->assertNoSmoke();

// assertNoSmoke() is a shorthand for:
// - assertNoJavascriptErrors()
// - assertNoConsoleLogs()
```

## Visual Regression Testing

Want to ensure your pages look exactly as expected over time? Pest v4 introduces visual regression
testing with the `assertScreenshotMatches()` assertion. This allows you to take screenshots of your
pages and compare them against baseline images, ensuring that your UI remains consistent across
changes.

```php
$pages = visit(['/', '/about', '/contact']);

$pages->assertScreenshotMatches();
```

This is just a glimpse of what Browser Testing in Pest v4 can do. Find out more about the new
features below, and check out the [Browser Testing documentation](/docs/browser-testing) for a
complete guide on how to get started.

## Test Sharding

Pest v4 introduces **Test Sharding**, allowing you to split your test suite into smaller, manageable
chunks. This is particularly useful for large applications (or when running browser tests) where
running all tests at once can be time-consuming.

This feature is particularly useful on CI platforms, where on things like GitHub actions you can no
longer scale vertical, but rather horizontally. This means you can run your tests in parallel across
multiple machines, significantly speeding up your test suite execution.

To get started with Test Sharding, you can use the `--shard` option when running Pest:

```bash
# GitHub Workflow One
./vendor/bin/pest --shard=1/4

# GitHub Workflow Two
./vendor/bin/pest --shard=2/4

# GitHub Workflow Three
./vendor/bin/pest --shard=3/4

# GitHub Workflow Four
./vendor/bin/pest --shard=4/4
```

You may combine this with the `--parallel` option to run your tests in parallel, and this way trully
maximize your test suite execution speed:

```bash
./vendor/bin/pest --shard=1/4 --parallel
```

Finally, to easily set up sharding your CI configuration, you just have to ensure each job in your
CI configuration runs a different shard of your test suite. For example, in GitHub Actions, you can
use the `matrix` strategy to define multiple jobs that run different shards:

```yaml
strategy:
    matrix:
        shard: [1, 2, 3, 4]

name: Tests (Shard ${{ matrix.shard }}/4)

steps:
    - name: Run tests
      run: pest --parallel --shard ${{ matrix.shard }}/4
```

## Type Coverage Is Much Faster

Remember the days when you had to wait for your type coverage to run? Not anymore! Pest v4
introduces a new type coverage engine that is significantly faster than previous versions.

Type coverage is 2x faster on the first run and instant on subsequent runs. This means you can
quickly check your type coverage without waiting for long periods, making your development workflow
much more efficient.

In addition, Type Coverage now supports **Sharding**. This means you can run type coverage with the
`--shard` option, just like you do with your tests.

## Profanity Checking

Pest v4 introduces a new feature that allows you to check for profanity in your test code. This is
particularly useful for maintaining a clean and professional codebase, especially in collaborative
environments.

You can enable profanity checking by adding the `--profanity` option when running Pest:

```bash
./vendor/bin/pest --profanity
```

To start using Pest's Profanity plugin, you need to require the plugin via Composer.

```bash
composer require pestphp/pest-plugin-profanity --dev
```

After requiring the plugin, you may utilize the `--profanity` option to generate a report of your
profanity.

```bash
./vendor/bin/pest --profanity
```

<img src="/assets/img/profanity.png" style="width: 100%;" />

If any of your files contain profanity, they will be highlighted in red and displayed using their
respective line numbers and the profane word(s) that have been found.

As an example, `pr31(f*ck)` means that the word "fuck" was found on line 31.

To learn more about the Profanity plugin and how to configure it, check out the
[Profanity documentation](/docs/profanity).

### Skip Locally or On CI

Pest v4 introduces the ability to conditionally skip tests based on the environment. You can use
`skipLocally()` to skip tests when running locally, or `skipOnCi` to skip tests when running on a CI
server.

```php
test('does not run locally', function () {
    // This test will be skipped when running locally
})->skipLocally();

test('does not run on CI', function () {
    // This test will be skipped when running on a CI server
})->skipOnCi();
```

### Miscellaneous Improvements

- You may now use `skipLocally()` or `skipOnCi` to conditionally skip tests based on the
  environment.
- The `not->toHaveSuspiciousCharacters()` arch expectation has been added to help you identify
  potential suspicious characters in your code. This arch expectation is now enabled by default on
  the `php` arch preset. This expectation requires the `intl` PHP extension.
- The expectation `toBeSlug` has been added to help you validate that a string is a valid slug.

### On Top of PHPUnit 12

Pest v4 is built on top of PHPUnit 12, which means you get all the latest features and improvements
from PHPUnit. As such, be sure to check out the
[PHPUnit 12 release announcement](https://phpunit.de/announcements/phpunit-12.html).
