## ✨ Key Features

### 🛡️ Multi-Layered Security System
*Stricter form security and data access control.*

- **Automated Bot Defense:** Integrated Cloudflare Turnstile and a "Honeypot" system to ensure only real humans can interact with registration and login forms.
- **Gatekeeper (Rate Limiter):** Suspiciously repeated login attempts are now automatically throttled to prevent account-probing attacks.
- **Secure Access Links (Signed URLs):** Critical system administrative links, such as the setup wizard, now use unique "digital signatures" that expire after a certain period.

### 🔒 Data Privacy Protection
*User privacy is our top priority.*

- **Database Encryption:** Personal information such as phone numbers, addresses, and identification numbers are now stored as secret codes in the database, remaining secure even in the event of unauthorized access.
- **Data Masking:** Sensitive information in system logs is now automatically redacted to prevent accidental data leaks.

### 🔑 Smart Password Validation
*The balance between convenience and high security.*

- **Adaptive Rules:** The system now automatically detects its environment. Password requirements are flexible for developers on their local machines but automatically escalate to maximum security levels once the application is live (Production).

### 🧪 Memory-Efficient Testing Orchestrator
*Stabilizing the verification process.*

- **Modular Orchestrator:** Introduced the `app:test` command which executes verification tests module-by-module. This ensures that the testing process does not exhaust device memory while maintaining a high standard of system reliability.
