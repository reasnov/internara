# Advanced Engineering: System Evolution Index

This index centralizes the technical records for the **Advanced Engineering** processes of the
Internara project, consistent with **ISO/IEC 12207**. It defines the protocols for systemic
evolution, specialized orchestrations, and future architectural roadmaps.

---

## 1. Modular Evolution Protocols

- **[Engineering Overview](advanced-overview.md)**: Applicability and compliance standards for
  advanced extensions.
- **[Custom Scaffolding](custom-module-generator.md)**: Protocols for the extension of automated
  modular generators.

## 2. Strategic Performance Roadmaps

- **Modular Hydration Tuning**: Protocols for the optimization of auto-discovery and state
  persistence cycles (Planned).
- **Service Mesh Architecture**: Internal communication scaling strategies for high-concurrency
  environments (Planned).

_Advanced orchestrations must satisfy the **[Code Quality Standardization](../code-quality-standardization.md)**
and demonstrate fulfillment of requirements defined in the System Requirements Specification._
