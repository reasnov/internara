# Application Blueprint: v0.4.0 (Institutional Foundation)

**Series Code**: `ARC01-INST-01` **Status**: `Archived` (Released)

> **Spec Alignment:** This blueprint implements the **Administrative Management** requirements 
> defined in the **[Internara Specs](../../../internara-specs.md)** (Section 1). It establishes the 
> "Centralized data storage" for institutions.

## 1. Core Problem Statement

The system lacks academic context (Schools, Departments). Users exist in a vacuum. Tight database 
coupling threatens modular portability.

**Goal**: Establish the Academic Hierarchy and enforce the "Zero Physical Foreign Key" rule.

---

## 2. Architectural Impact

### 2.1 Domain: Academic Hierarchy
- **New Modules**: `School`, `Department`.
- **Data Layer**:
    - `schools` table (UUID Primary Key).
    - `departments` table (UUID Primary Key).
- **Rule**: Removal of physical foreign keys between modules.

### 2.2 Infrastructure: Isolation
- **Replacement**: Use of indexed UUID columns and Service-layer integrity checks.

---

## 3. UI/UX Strategy

- **Mobile-First:** Administrative tables for managing departments must be responsive.
- **Multi-Language (i11n):** Institutional names and descriptions support localization.

---

## 4. Contract Definitions

| Contract | Owner Module | Consumer | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `DepartmentService` | `Department` | `User`, `Profile` | Provides institutional context and validates logical integrity, fulfilling the role of a lookup service. |

---

## 5. Exit Criteria

- [x] **Logical Integrity**: Deleting a master record does not crash related modules (Graceful degradation).
- [x] **Capacity Logic**: Internship slots defined per department.
- [x] **Spec Verification**: Fulfills administrative data structure requirements.

---

## 6. vNext Roadmap (v0.5.0)

- **Operational Layer**: Tracking daily activities.
- **Academic Scoping**: Multi-year data management.
