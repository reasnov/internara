# Application Blueprint: v0.4.0 (Institutional Foundation)

**Series Code**: `ARC01-INST-01` **Status**: `Archived` (Released)

---

## 1. Core Problem Statement

The system currently lacks academic context. Users exist in a vacuum without belonging to a School
or Department. Furthermore, tight database coupling (Foreign Keys) threatens the independent
portability of future modules.

**Goal**: Establish the Academic Hierarchy and enforce the "Zero Physical Foreign Key" rule.

---

## 2. Architectural Impact

### 2.1 Domain: Academic Hierarchy

- **New Modules**: `School`, `Department`, `Internship`.
- **Logic**: Managing capacity tracking for internship programs.

### 2.2 Infrastructure: Database Isolation

- **Rule**: Removal of physical foreign keys between modules.
- **Replacement**: Use of indexed UUID columns and Service-layer integrity checks.

## 3. Contract Definitions

| Contract           | Owner Module | Consumer  | Purpose                                                                         |
| :----------------- | :----------- | :-------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `DepartmentLookup` | `Department` | `Profile` | Validates department existence during profile creation without a DB constraint. |

---

## 4. Exit Criteria

The v0.4.0 series is considered complete when:

- [x] **Logical Integrity**: Deleting a master record (Department) does not crash related modules,
      handled gracefully by Services.
- [x] **Capacity Logic**: Internship slots cannot be over-subscribed.
- [x] **Localization**: Multi-language (EN/ID) support is active.

---

## 5. vNext Roadmap (v0.5.0)

- **Operational Layer**: Tracking daily activities (Journals, Attendance).
- **Academic Scoping**: Handling multi-year data.
