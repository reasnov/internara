# Application Blueprints: Strategic Design Index

This index centralizes the **Architecture Design Records (ADR)** for the Internara project. Every
development series originates as a blueprint, providing the bridge between requirements and
technical implementation.

---

## 1. Governance & Standards

- **[Blueprint Design Guidelines](../blueprints-guidelines.md)**: Standards for the elicitation and
  formalization of design intent.

## 2. Active & Planned Development Series

- **[10-ARC01-GAP-01 (Integrative Excellence)](10-ARC01-GAP-01-Integrative-Excellence.md)**
    - **Status**: `Planned`
    - **Focus**: Competency Rubrics, Mentoring Logs, and Schedule Management.

- **[09-ARC01-BOOT-01 (System Initialization)](09-ARC01-BOOT-01-System-Initialization.md)**
    - **Status**: `Completed`
    - **Focus**: Automated CLI installation, Web Wizard, and System/SMTP configuration.

## 3. Realized Design Baselines (Released)

- **[08-ARC01-INTEL-01 (Reporting & Intelligence)](08-ARC01-INTEL-01-Reporting-Intelligence.md)**
- **[07-ARC01-ORCH-01 (Administrative Orchestration)](07-ARC01-ORCH-01-Administrative-Orchestration.md)**
- **[06-ARC01-FEAT-01 (Assessment & Workspaces)](06-ARC01-FEAT-01-Assessment-Workspaces.md)**

## 4. Historical Design Archive

- **[Archived Blueprints Index](archived/table-of-contents.md)**: Formal records of decommissioned
  or legacy designs.

_Once a design intent is successfully realized in a release, its blueprint is archived and the
as-built outcome is documented in the **[Release Baselines](../../versions/versions-overview.md)**._
