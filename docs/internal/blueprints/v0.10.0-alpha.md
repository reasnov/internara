# Application Blueprint: v0.10.0 (Integrative Excellence & Competency Mastery)

**Series Code**: `ARC01-GAP-01` **Status**: `Planned`

> **Spec Alignment:** This blueprint addresses the final remaining gaps in the **[Internara Specs](../../internara-specs.md)**, specifically **Competency Achievements** (Section 2.2), **Mentoring Documentation** (Section 2.3), **Schedule Management** (Section 1.1), and **Product Feasibility Criteria** (Section 7).

---

## 1. Core Problem Statement

While Internara v0.1-v0.9 successfully tracks "what happened" (Journals, Attendance), it lacks the "Instructional Framework" required by the Specs. Currently, there is no way to define *which* specific competencies a student must achieve, no formal log for mentoring sessions (dialogue), and no administrative tool to plan schedules before the internship begins.

**Goal**: Complete the instructional loop by implementing Competency Mapping, Mentoring Logs, and Schedule Planning.

---

## 2. Architectural Impact

### 2.1 Domain: Competency Framework (`modules/Assessment` enhancement)
- **New Feature**: Competency Rubrics.
- **Logic**: Allows Staff/Teachers to define a list of skills/competencies per Department.
- **Mapping**: Linking Journal categories to specific competencies for automated progress visualization.

### 2.2 Domain: Mentoring Dialogue (`modules/Mentor` & `modules/Teacher` enhancement)
- **Feature**: Mentoring Session Logs.
- **Difference from Journal**: Journals are student-led; Mentoring Logs are supervisor-led (Instructor/Industry Mentor) to document feedback, advice, and on-site visit notes as mandated by Specs Section 2.3.
- **Data Layer**: `mentoring_sessions` table (UUID, polymorphic supervisor reference).

### 2.3 Domain: Schedule Management (`modules/Internship` enhancement)
- **Feature**: Internship Timelines.
- **Logic**: Administrative tool to set start/end dates, work days, and expected hours for each internship placement.
- **Validation**: Attendance and Journals will be validated against these planned schedules.

### 2.4 Domain: System Evaluation (`modules/Support` enhancement)
- **Feature**: Feasibility Surveys.
- **Logic**: In-app feedback mechanism to collect usability data from Instructors, Students, and Staff to fulfill the "Product Feasibility Criteria" (Specs Section 7).

## 3. UI/UX Strategy

- **Mobile-First**:
    - **Competency Radar**: Responsive visualization of skill achievements on the student dashboard.
    - **Quick-Log Visit**: A simplified "On-site Visit" form for Instructors using their mobile devices.
- **Multi-Language (i11n)**:
    - Competency names, rubric descriptions, and survey questions must be fully localized.

## 4. Contract Definitions

| Contract | Owner Module | Consumer | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `CompetencyManager` | `Assessment` | `Journal` | Maps journal activities to curriculum competencies. |
| `ScheduleService` | `Internship` | `Attendance` | Provides the expected work schedule for a given student. |
| `FeedbackCollector` | `Support` | `All` | Standard interface for capturing user feasibility data. |
