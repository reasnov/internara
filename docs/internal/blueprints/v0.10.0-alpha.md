# Application Blueprint: v0.10.0 (Integrative Excellence & Competency Mastery)

**Series Code**: `ARC01-GAP-01` **Status**: `Planned`

> **Spec Alignment:** This blueprint addresses the final remaining gaps in the
> **[Internara Specs](../../internara-specs.md)**, specifically **Competency Achievements** (Section
> 2.2), **Mentoring Documentation** (Section 2.3), **Schedule Management** (Section 1.1), and
> **Product Feasibility Criteria** (Section 7).

## 1. Version Goals and Scopes (Core Problem Statement)

**Purpose**: Complete the instructional loop by implementing a formal framework for competencies, supervisor mentoring sessions, and administrative schedule planning.

**Objectives**:
- Enable evidence-based competency tracking mapped to the curriculum.
- Document formal mentoring dialogue between students and supervisors.
- Provide administrative control over internship timelines.
- Collect usability feedback for project feasibility evaluation.

**Scope**:
Internara v0.1-v0.9 tracks activity, but lacks the "Instructional Framework" required by the Specs. There is no way to define specific competencies, no formal log for mentoring dialogue, and no administrative tool to plan schedules.

---

## 2. Functional Specifications

**Feature Set**:
- **Competency Rubrics**: Tools for Teachers to define and map skills per department.
- **Mentoring Dialogue Logs**: Supervisor-led logs to document feedback and on-site visit notes.
- **Internship Timelines**: Administrative management of start/end dates and expected work days.
- **Feasibility Surveys**: In-app usability feedback system for project evaluation.

**User Stories**:
- As a **Teacher**, I want to define which competencies students should achieve so that the system can track their progress automatically.
- As a **Mentor**, I want to log a formal mentoring session to document the advice and feedback I gave the student today.
- As a **Staff**, I want to set the official start and end dates for an internship cohort to enforce attendance rules.

## 3. Technical Architecture (Architectural Impact)

**Modules**:
- **Assessment**: Enhanced to handle Competency Rubrics and mapping logic.
- **Mentor/Teacher**: Enhanced with specialized "Mentoring Session" polymorphic logs.
- **Internship**: Enhanced with Schedule/Timeline management features.
- **Support**: New survey engine for feasibility data collection.

**Data Layer**:
- **Frameworks**: `competencies`, `mentoring_sessions`, and `internship_schedules` tables (UUID-based).
- **Validation**: Attendance and Journal services will be updated to validate against planned schedules.

## 4. UX/UI Design Specifications (UI/UX Strategy)

**Design Philosophy**: Instructional clarity and structured feedback loops.

**User Flow**:
1. Staff/Teacher defines the competency rubric for a specific department.
2. System maps journal entry categories to these competencies.
3. Supervisor performs an on-site visit and opens the "Mentoring Log" on their mobile device.
4. Supervisor records the session notes and student progress against the rubric.
5. Student views their "Competency Radar" to see achievement levels in real-time.

**Mobile-First**:
- **Competency Radar**: Responsive visualization optimized for mobile dashboard viewing.
- **Quick-Log Visit**: Simplified form for supervisors to log visits while on-site.

**Multi-Language**:
- Rubrics, mentoring logs, and survey questions are fully localized in **Indonesian** and **English**.

---

## 5. Success Metrics (KPIs)

- **Instructional Alignment**: 100% of departments have defined competency rubrics.
- **Engagement Quality**: At least 1 formal mentoring log per student every 2 weeks.
- **Operational Precision**: 0 attendance logs allowed outside of the planned internship schedule dates.
- **Feasibility**: Achieve a minimum usability score of 4.0/5.0 across all user roles via internal surveys.

---

## 6. Quality Assurance (QA) Criteria (Exit Criteria)

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] **Competency Mapping**: Journal-to-skill visualization is active and accurate.
- [ ] **Formal Mentoring**: Supervisor-led logs correctly store polymorphic references.
- [ ] **Schedule Control**: Staff can successfully enforce cohort-wide internship timelines.

**Testing Protocols**:
- [ ] Logic tests for schedule-based attendance validation.
- [ ] Multi-locale verification of rubric and survey content.

**Quality Gates**:
- [ ] **Spec Verification**: 100% coverage of remaining requirements in `internara-specs.md`.
- [ ] Static Analysis Clean.

## 7. vNext Roadmap (v1.0.0-RC: Release Candidate)

- **End-to-End Simulation**: Full lifecycle testing from Setup to Graduation.
- **Performance Benchmarking**: Mobile responsiveness under concurrent load.
- **Documentation Freeze**: Finalizing all internal and user-facing guides.
