# Application Blueprint: v0.5.0 (Operational Layer)

**Series Code**: `ARC01-OPER-01` **Status**: `Archived` (Released)

---

## 1. Core Problem Statement

We have the structure (Schools, Users), but no activity tracking. There is no mechanism to record
"what happened today" (Attendance, Journals) or to scope data by Academic Year.

**Goal**: Implement high-frequency tracking systems and data scoping.

---

## 2. Architectural Impact

### 2.1 Domain: Operational Tracking

- **New Modules**: `Journal`, `Attendance`.
- **Feature**: Evidence-based tracking (Photo/Location for attendance, Files for journals).

### 2.2 Domain: Data Scoping

- **Concern**: `HasAcademicYear`.
- **Logic**: Automatic injection of the active academic year into operational records to prevent
  data pollution across cohorts.

## 3. Contract Definitions

| Contract            | Owner Module | Consumer                | Purpose                                             |
| :------------------ | :----------- | :---------------------- | :-------------------------------------------------- |
| `AcademicYearScope` | `Core`       | `Journal`, `Attendance` | Provides the currently active Global Academic Year. |

## 4. Exit Criteria

The v0.5.0 series is considered complete when:

- [x] **Immutable History**: Approved journals cannot be edited.
- [x] **Cohort Isolation**: Data queries automatically filter by the active academic year.
- [x] **Secure Media**: Attachments are stored on private disks with Signed URLs.

## 5. vNext Roadmap (v0.6.0)

- **Assessment Engine**: Grading and Certification.
- **Workspaces**: Decomposing the Dashboard.
