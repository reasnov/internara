# Application Blueprint: v0.6.0 (Assessment & Workspaces)

**Series Code**: `ARC01-FEAT-01` **Status**: `Archived` (Released)

> **Spec Alignment:** This blueprint implements the **Student Progress Monitoring** (Section 2) and
> **Mentoring and Evaluation** (Section 3) of the **[Internara Specs](../../internara-specs.md)**.
> It introduces the Role-Specific Workspaces mandated by the specs.

## 1. Core Problem Statement

The application is "feature-complete" but "role-confused." All users share a generic dashboard.
Furthermore, while activities are tracked, there is no formal mechanism to Grade them or issue
Certificates.

**Goal**: Decompose the UI into dedicated Workspaces and implement the Assessment Engine.

---

## 2. Architectural Impact

### 2.1 Domain: Workspace Decomposition

- **Deprecation**: Monolithic `Dashboard` module removed.
- **New Structure**:
    - `modules/Teacher` (Instructor Workspace).
    - `modules/Student` (Student Workspace).
    - `modules/Mentor` (Industry Supervisor Workspace).
    - `modules/Admin` (Staff/Admin Workspace).

### 2.2 Domain: Assessment Engine (`modules/Assessment`)

- **Feature**: Certificate Generation with QR Verification.
- **Data Layer**:
    - `assessments` table (UUID Primary Key).
    - No physical FKs to User or Internship modules.

---

## 3. UI/UX Strategy

- **Mobile-First:**
    - Student workspace must prioritize "Daily Tasks" visibility on mobile.
    - Industry Supervisor evaluation forms must be touch-friendly.
- **Multi-Language (i11n):**
    - All certificates and transcripts must be fully localized (ID/EN).
    - Workspace navigation labels must be localized.

## 4. Contract Definitions

| Contract            | Owner Module | Consumer     | Purpose                                                                 |
| :------------------ | :----------- | :----------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `AssessmentService` | `Assessment` | `Workspaces` | Standard interface for retrieving scores regardless of the user's role. |

---

## 5. Exit Criteria

- [x] **Role Clarity**: Strict separation of routes (Students cannot access Admin/Staff routes).
- [x] **Certificate Generation**: PDF generation with verifiable QR code active.
- [x] **Unified Grading**: Assessment logic centralized in `Assessment` module.
- [x] **Spec Verification**: Workspaces match the "Users" section of the Specs.

## 6. vNext Roadmap (v0.7.0)

- **Administrative Orchestration**: Automated prerequisite checks and auto-grading.
- **System Visibility**: Global notifications and batch monitoring.
