# Application Blueprint: v0.6.0 (Assessment & Workspaces)

**Series Code**: `ARC01-FEAT-01` **Status**: `Archived` (Released)

> **Spec Alignment:** This blueprint implements the **Student Progress Monitoring** (Section 2) and
> **Mentoring and Evaluation** (Section 3) of the **[Internara Specs](../../internara-specs.md)**.
> It introduces the Role-Specific Workspaces mandated by the specs.

## 1. Version Goals and Scopes (Core Problem Statement)

**Purpose**: Decompose the application into dedicated role-based workspaces and implement a formal
assessment and certification engine.

**Objectives**:

- Provide clear boundaries between User Roles (Instructor, Staff, Student, Mentor).
- Standardize the evaluation process and automate certificate issuance.

**Scope**: The application was functionally rich but "role-confused," with all users sharing a
generic dashboard. Furthermore, while activities were tracked, there was no formal mechanism to
grade them or issue verifiable certificates.

---

## 2. Functional Specifications

**Feature Set**:

- **Role-Specific Workspaces**: Dedicated dashboards and navigation for Admin, Student, Teacher, and
  Mentor.
- **Assessment Engine**: Unified scoring system for supervisors and teachers.
- **Verifiable Certificates**: Automated generation of Certificates of Completion with QR code
  verification.

**User Stories**:

- As a **Mentor**, I want a dedicated space to review my assigned interns so that I can provide
  feedback efficiently.
- As a **Student**, I want to download my verified certificate once my internship is completed.
- As an **Admin**, I want to see a unified transcript of student scores across all competency areas.

## 3. Technical Architecture (Architectural Impact)

**Modules**:

- **Workspaces**: Decomposed into `Admin`, `Student`, `Teacher`, and `Mentor` modules.
- **Assessment**: New module for grading logic and certificate generation.
- **UI**: Centralized layout engine for consistent role-specific themes.

**Data Layer**:

- **Assessments**: `assessments` table with UUID-based identification.
- **Isolation**: Workspaces consume assessment data via service-layer abstractions.

## 4. UX/UI Design Specifications (UI/UX Strategy)

**Design Philosophy**: Role-centric clarity and professional credentialing.

**User Flow**:

1. User logs in and is automatically routed to their role-specific dashboard (e.g., `/student`).
2. Supervisor (Mentor/Teacher) completes the assessment form for a student.
3. System calculates the final grade and unlocks the "Download Certificate" action for the student.
4. Student downloads the PDF certificate.
5. Third-party scans the QR code on the certificate to verify its authenticity via a public landing
   page.

**Mobile-First**:

- Student dashboards prioritize high-frequency tasks (Daily Journal) on mobile devices.
- Mentor evaluation forms are optimized for rapid input on touch interfaces.

**Multi-Language**:

- All certificates, transcripts, and workspace navigation are fully localized in **Indonesian** and
  **English**.

---

## 5. Success Metrics (KPIs)

- **Role Isolation**: 100% of routes correctly protected by role-based middleware.
- **Certification Speed**: Certificates are available for download within 1 second of assessment
  finalization.
- **Usability**: 30% reduction in support queries related to "where to find" specific features due
  to dedicated workspaces.

---

## 6. Quality Assurance (QA) Criteria (Exit Criteria)

**Acceptance Criteria**:

- [x] **Role Separation**: Students cannot access staff routes; mentors see only their interns.
- [x] **Verifiable Output**: QR codes on certificates correctly link to the verification landing
      page.

**Testing Protocols**:

- [x] Access control tests for all role-specific routes.
- [x] PDF layout verification for Certificates and Transcripts.

**Quality Gates**:

- [x] **Spec Verification**: Workspaces match the "Users" section of the Internara Specs.
- [x] Static Analysis Clean.

## 7. vNext Roadmap (v0.7.0: Administrative Orchestration)

- **Requirement Engine**: Automated prerequisite verification.
- **Auto-Grading**: Linking compliance logs directly to scores.
