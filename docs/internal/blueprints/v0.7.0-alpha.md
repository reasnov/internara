# Application Blueprint: v0.7.0 (Administrative Orchestration)

**Series Code**: `ARC01-ORCH-01` **Status**: `Released`

> **Spec Alignment:** This blueprint implements the **Administrative Management** requirements
> defined in the **[Internara Specs](../../internara-specs.md)** (Section 1). It focuses on
> "Automated Requirement Verification" and centralized administrative control.

## 1. Version Goals and Scopes (Core Problem Statement)

**Purpose**: Transform Internara into an "Active Orchestrator" that enforces administrative rules
automatically to reduce bottlenecks and human error.

**Objectives**:

- Automate the enforcement of internship prerequisites.
- Implement participation-driven scoring for more objective assessments.
- Enhance administrative efficiency via bulk operations.

**Scope**: Admins rely on manual verification for internships and assessments, leading to delays.
There is no automated enforcement of prerequisites like parent permission letters. This version
introduces an engine to handle these verifications.

## 2. Functional Specifications

**Feature Set**:

- **Requirements Engine**: System for defining, submitting, and verifying mandatory internship
  prerequisites.
- **Participation-Driven Scoring**: Automated student scores calculated based on attendance and
  journal compliance.
- **Bulk Placement Engine**: Tools for batch assigning students to industry partners.
- **Global Notifier**: Standardized system-wide UI feedback (Toasts).

**User Stories**:

- As a **Student**, I want to see which documents I must upload so that I can proceed with my
  internship registration.
- As a **Staff**, I want to verify a batch of student documents quickly so that they can be assigned
  to partners.
- As a **Teacher**, I want the system to calculate an initial score based on attendance so that I
  can focus on qualitative evaluation.

## 3. Technical Architecture (Architectural Impact)

**Modules**:

- **Internship**: Enhanced with the `InternshipRequirement` validation logic and bulk assignment
  features.
- **Assessment**: Integrated with `Attendance` and `Journal` modules for compliance metrics.
- **Notification**: New module for orchestrating global UI feedback.

**Data Layer**:

- **Requirements**: `internship_requirements` and `requirement_submissions` tables (UUID-based).
- **Isolation**: Service-to-service communication via contracts for metric retrieval.

## 4. UX/UI Design Specifications (UI/UX Strategy)

**Design Philosophy**: Streamlined administrative workflows and automated feedback.

**User Flow**:

1. Student views the required list of documents on their dashboard.
2. Student uploads the requested files.
3. Staff receives a notification and reviews the submission queue.
4. Staff approves or rejects (with reason) the submissions.
5. System unlocks the "Ready for Placement" status once all requirements are met.

**Mobile-First**:

- Requirement submission forms are optimized for mobile document capturing.
- Admin verification queues support responsive card views.

**Multi-Language**:

- All requirement descriptions, rejection reasons, and notification messages support **Indonesian**
  and **English**.

## 5. Success Metrics (KPIs)

- **Verification Velocity**: Reduce document review time by 50% through centralized queues.
- **Accuracy**: 100% of placed students meet the mandatory institutional prerequisites.
- **Compliance**: Increase average journal submission rates by 20% due to the transparent
  auto-scoring impact.

## 6. Quality Assurance (QA) Criteria (Exit Criteria)

**Acceptance Criteria**:

- [x] **Dynamic Prerequisites**: Requirement Manager UI implemented and verified against Specs.
- [x] **Auto-Grading**: Final grades correctly incorporate weights from attendance and journal logs.

**Testing Protocols**:

- [x] Integration tests for the requirement validation lifecycle.
- [x] Role-based access tests for verification queues.

**Quality Gates**:

- [x] **Spec Verification**: Validated "Administrative Management" workflow alignment.
- [x] Static Analysis Clean.

## 7. vNext Roadmap (v0.8.0: Reporting & Intelligence)

- **Reporting Engine**: Synthesis of raw data into PDF analytics.
- **Placement History**: Traceable logs for rotational programs.
