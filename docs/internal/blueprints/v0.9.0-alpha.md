# Application Blueprint: v0.9.0 (System Initialization)

**Series Code**: `ARC01-BOOT-01` **Status**: `Planned`

> **Spec Alignment:** This blueprint implements the **Platform and Technology** requirements
> (Section 5) and **Administrative Management** (Section 1) of the
> **[Internara Specs](../../internara-specs.md)**. It focuses on reducing deployment friction.

## 1. Version Goals and Scopes (Core Problem Statement)

**Purpose**: Automate the system initialization process to ensure a reliable and fast deployment experience.

**Objectives**:
- Eliminate manual configuration errors during setup.
- Provide a professional onboarding experience for institutional administrators.

**Scope**:
Deploying Internara currently requires manual CLI steps (migrations, seeding, env configuration) which is prone to human error. This version introduces automated tools to handle these tasks.

---

## 2. Functional Specifications

**Feature Set**:
- **Automated Installer CLI**: A single command to bootstrap the entire environment.
- **Web Setup Wizard**: A graphical interface for initial institutional configuration.

**User Stories**:
- As an **IT Staff**, I want to run a single command to install the system so that I don't miss critical setup steps.
- As a **Principal/Admin**, I want a web interface to configure my school's logo and name during the first run so that the system reflects our identity immediately.

## 3. Technical Architecture (Architectural Impact)

**Modules**:
- **Setup**: New module dedicated to installation and initialization logic.

**Data Layer**:
- **Seeding**: Orchestration of Core and Shared seeders to establish foundational roles and settings.

**Settings**:
- Integration with the `Setting` module to persist `brand_name`, `brand_logo`, and SMTP details during the wizard flow.

## 4. UX/UI Design Specifications (UI/UX Strategy)

**Design Philosophy**: Minimalist, guided, and high-trust onboarding.

**User Flow**:
1. System performs an automated server and environment requirement check.
2. User configures basic environment variables (Database, App URL) via a guided form.
3. User uploads institutional branding assets (Logo, Name).
4. User creates the initial Super-Administrator account.
5. System confirms completion and redirects to the login page.

**Mobile-First**:
- Setup Wizard is fully responsive, allowing administrators to perform initial configuration via tablet or mobile.

**Multi-Language**:
- All wizard steps and CLI prompts support **Indonesian** and **English**.

---

## 5. Success Metrics (KPIs)

- **Installation Velocity**: Reduce average setup time from 15 minutes (manual) to under 2 minutes.
- **Reliability**: 0% manual `.env` configuration errors reported during installation.
- **Adoption**: 100% of new installations successfully complete the Web Wizard.

---

## 6. Quality Assurance (QA) Criteria (Exit Criteria)

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] **Zero-Config Install**: `app:install` successfully bootstraps a fresh environment without manual intervention.
- [ ] **Wizard Completion**: Institutional branding correctly persists to `setting()`.

**Testing Protocols**:
- [ ] 100% Test Pass Rate for the `Setup` module.
- [ ] Manual verification of the wizard flow on mobile and desktop devices.

**Quality Gates**:
- [ ] **Spec Verification**: Meets "Integrated platform for managing practical work systematically."
- [ ] Static Analysis Clean (`pint`, `lint`).

## 7. vNext Roadmap (v0.10.0: Integrative Excellence & Competency Mastery)

- **Competency Mapping**: Linking journals to curriculum rubrics.
- **Mentoring Dialogue**: Formal feedback logs for Instructors/Mentors.
