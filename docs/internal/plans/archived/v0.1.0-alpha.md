# Engineering Plan: v0.1.0 (Genesis)

**Series Code**: `ARC01-INIT-01` **Status**: `Archived` (Released)

---

## 1. Core Problem Statement

Standard Laravel applications often suffer from "Monolithic Decay," where business logic becomes
tangled and difficult to maintain as complexity grows. We need a structure that enforces strict
domain separation from Day 1 to allow for scalable future development.

**Goal**: Establish the Modular Monolith foundation and basic engineering standards.

---

## 2. Architectural Impact

### 2.1 Infrastructure: Modular Bootstrapping

- **Structure**: Adoption of `nwidart/laravel-modules`.
- **Constraint**: `app/` directory reserved strictly for infrastructure; all domains in `modules/`.

### 2.2 Domain: UI Centralization

- **New Module**: `UI`.
- **Scope**: Encapsulation of all assets (Tailwind 4, Alpine, Livewire) to ensure a single source of
  truth for the design system.

## 3. Contract Definitions

| Contract | Owner Module | Consumer | Purpose                                                         |
| :------- | :----------- | :------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------- |
| N/A      | N/A          | N/A      | Initial phase; focus on directory structure and auto-discovery. |

---

## 4. Exit Criteria

The v0.1.0 series is considered complete when:

- [x] **Modular Autoloading**: `BindServiceProvider` correctly auto-discovers interfaces and
      implementations within modules.
- [x] **Asset Pipeline**: Vite correctly bundles resources from active modules.
- [x] **Namespace Standard**: All modules follow the `Modules\{Name}` convention (omitting `src`).

---

## 5. vNext Roadmap (v0.2.0)

- **Shared Utilities**: Establishing the "Engine Room" for common traits.
- **RBAC**: Implementing the modular permission system.
