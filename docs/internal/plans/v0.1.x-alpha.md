# Engineering Plan: v0.1.x (ARC01-INIT-01)

**Series Code**: `ARC01-INIT-01` **Status**: `Released` (Alpha Milestone)

This plan documents the "Genesis Phase" of Internara, establishing the core Modular Monolith
foundation and the project's engineering standards.

## 1. Architectural Philosophy (The "How")

### 1.1 Prevention of Monolithic Decay

Standard Laravel applications often suffer from tangled business logic. To prevent this, we adopted
a **Modular Monolith** pattern using `nwidart/laravel-modules`.

- **Constraint**: The `app/` directory is reserved for infrastructure bootstrapping.
- **Rule**: All business domains must reside within `modules/`.

### 1.2 Service-Oriented Orchestration

We established a strict downward flow: **UI -> Service -> Model**.

- **Logic**: All orchestration must reside in Services.
- **Decoupling**: Inter-module communication must happen via **Contracts**.

## 2. Implementation Keystones

### 2.1 The Auto-Discovery Engine

We implemented the `BindServiceProvider` to automate Dependency Injection.

- **Mechanism**: Automatically maps **Contracts** to implementations based on directory structure.
- **Impact**: Enforces an **Interface-First** mindset and eliminates Provider boilerplate.

### 2.2 Centralized UI Module

All frontend assets (Tailwind CSS 4, Alpine.js, Livewire 3) are encapsulated in the `UI` module.

- **Why?**: To ensure a **Single Source of Truth** for the application's design system.
- **Tech**: Integrated **MaryUI** and **DaisyUI** for high-level interactive components.

## 3. QA & Strategy

### 3.1 Verification Analysis

- **Scaffolding Audit**: Verified that modular generators respect the namespace convention (omitting
  the `src` segment).
- **Asset Pipeline**: Confirmed that Vite correctly bundles resources from all active modules.

### 3.2 Roadmap Strategy (vNext)

The next cycle (**v0.2.x**) will focus on building the **Shared** utilities and the modular
**Permission** (RBAC) infrastructure.
