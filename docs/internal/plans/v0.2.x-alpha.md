# Engineering Plan: v0.2.x (ARC01-CORE-01)

**Series Code**: `ARC01-CORE-01` **Status**: `Released` (Alpha Milestone)

This cycle focused on engineering the "Engine Room" of Internara, establishing universal
**Concerns** and the modular **RBAC** (Role-Based Access Control) infrastructure.

---

## 1. Architectural Strategy: Shared-First

To prevent logic duplication, we established the `Shared` module as the repository for all
business-agnostic code.

- **Requirement**: Any utility that can function without Internara's specific business rules must
  reside here.
- **Constraint**: Models requiring unique identity MUST use the `HasUuid` **Concern**.

---

## 2. Implementation Keystones

### 2.1 The `EloquentQuery` Architecture

We developed the `EloquentQuery` base service to standardize model interactions.

- **Goal**: Abstract common querying and CRUD logic.
- **Impact**: Domain services now inherit advanced filtering and sorting capabilities, reducing
  boilerplate by ~60%.

### 2.2 Portable Permission Module

We encapsulated `spatie/laravel-permission` into a dedicated module.

- **Technical**: Implemented full **UUID** support and runtime configuration injection.
- **Security**: Introduced **Policy Patterns** where domain modules define abilities, while the
  `Permission` module manages the storage.

---

## 3. QA & Strategy

### 3.1 Verification Analysis

- **Unit Testing**: 100% coverage for the `HasUuid` and `HasStatuses` **Concerns**.
- **Security Audit**: Verified that inter-module authorization checks are performed strictly through
  standard Laravel Gates/Policies.

### 3.2 Roadmap Strategy (vNext)

The next milestone (**v0.3.x**) will build the **User & Auth** domains, leveraging the RBAC system
to support multi-role academic profiles.
