# Engineering Plan: v0.4.x (ARC01-INST-01)

**Series Code**: `ARC01-INST-01` **Status**: `Released` (Alpha Milestone)

This milestone established the "Academic Foundation" of Internara. We introduced school and
department management, implemented placement tracking, and enforced a zero-leak database strategy.

## 1. Architectural Strategy: Database Isolation

To ensure modular portability, we moved from physical database constraints to application-level
integrity.

- **Rule**: Physical foreign keys across module boundaries are strictly prohibited.
- **Mechanism**: Use indexed UUID columns. Integrity is guarded by the **Service Layer** using
  cross-module **Contracts**.

## 2. Implementation Keystones

### 2.1 Academic Hierarchy & Localization

We implemented the `School` and `Department` modules to provide academic context for users.

- **Features**: Multi-language support (EN/ID) was finalized, including a real-time UI switcher.
- **Data**: Established the first set of "Master Data" services for institutional metadata.

### 2.2 Placement & Capacity Tracking

Introduced the `Internship` module to manage industry partner slots.

- **Logic**: Built-in capacity checks prevent over-filling of placement programs.
- **Security**: Integrated UUIDs for all institutional models to eliminate ID enumeration risks.

## 3. QA & Strategy

### 3.1 Verification Analysis

- **Integrity Check**: Verified that deleting a `Department` record does not crash the linked
  `Profile` views (handled via Service logic).
- **Standards Audit**: Overhauled the **Release Guidelines** and **Software Lifecycle** docs.

### 3.2 Roadmap Strategy (vNext)

The next cycle (**v0.5.x**) will transition from setup to usage, focusing on **Operational
Tracking** (Journals & Attendance).
