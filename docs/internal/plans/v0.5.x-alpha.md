# Engineering Plan: v0.5.x (ARC01-OPER-01)

**Series Code**: `ARC01-OPER-01` **Status**: `Released` (Alpha Milestone)

This version introduced the "Operational Layer" of Internara, focusing on high-frequency tracking
systems for student activity, attendance, and formal supervisor relationships.

## 1. Architectural Strategy: UI Abstraction

To ensure a cohesive visual identity, we moved away from raw CSS classes in business modules.

- **Rule**: Direct use of Tailwind or DaisyUI classes for core elements is forbidden.
- **Standard**: Feature modules MUST use standardized `x-ui::` components from the `UI` module.
- **Impact**: Standardized on **Tabler Icons** across the entire application using the `tabler.name`
  dot-notation format.

## 2. Implementation Keystones

### 2.1 Multi-Year Academic Scoping

Data integrity across cohorts was prioritized.

- **Mechanism**: Introduced the `HasAcademicYear` **Concern**.
- **Automation**: Operational services now automatically inject the active year into `attendance`
  and `journal` records.

### 2.2 Integrity-Driven Journal System

Built the `Journal` module with a focus on auditability.

- **Strict Locking**: Once an entry is approved or verified, it becomes immutable via Policy
  enforcement.
- **Assets**: Integrated `MediaLibrary` for student attachments, stored on a private disk and
  accessed via Signed URLs.

### 2.3 Dynamic Attendance Engine

- **Logic**: Check-in thresholds (e.g., Late after 08:00) are now database-configurable rather than
  hardcoded.

## 3. QA & Strategy

### 3.1 Verification Analysis

- **Pass Rate**: 100% across 49 Feature and Unit tests (Pest).
- **Security Audit**: Verified that Mentors/Teachers can only access logs for students directly
  assigned to them (Ownership check).

### 3.2 Roadmap Strategy (vNext)

The next cycle (**v0.6.x**) will finalize the core lifecycle with the **Assessment Engine** and
automated PDF reporting.
