# Engineering Plan: v0.6.0 (Assessment & Workspaces)

**Series Code**: `ARC01-FEAT-01`
**Status**: `Archived` (Released)

---

## 1. Core Problem Statement

The application has become "feature-complete" but "role-confused." All users share a single generic Dashboard.
Additionally, while we track activity, we cannot Grade it or issue Certificates.

**Goal**: Decompose the UI into role-specific Workspaces and implement the Assessment Engine.

---

## 2. Architectural Impact

### 2.1 Domain: Workspace Decomposition
*   **Deprecation**: Removal of the monolithic `Dashboard` module.
*   **New Structure**: Dedicated routes/layouts for `Admin`, `Student`, `Teacher`, `Mentor`.

### 2.2 Domain: Assessment Engine
*   **New Module**: `Assessment`.
*   **Feature**: Automated PDF generation (Certificates) using `laravel-dompdf`.

## 3. Contract Definitions

| Contract | Owner Module | Consumer | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `AssessmentService` | `Assessment` | `Workspaces` | Standard interface for retrieving scores regardless of the user's role. |

---

## 4. Exit Criteria

The v0.6.0 series is considered complete when:

- [x] **Role Clarity**: Students cannot access Admin routes (403 Forbidden).
- [x] **Certificate Generation**: System can generate a PDF with a verifiable QR code.
- [x] **Unified Grading**: Assessment logic is centralized, not scattered across controllers.

---

## 5. vNext Roadmap (v0.7.0)

*   **Orchestration**: Automated prerequisite checks and auto-grading.
*   **System Visibility**: Global notifications and batch monitoring.
