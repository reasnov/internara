# Engineering Plan: v0.6.x (Assessment & Workspaces)

**Series Code**: `ARC01-FEAT-01` **Status**: `Released` (Alpha Milestone)

This plan documents the transition from a monolithic tracking system to a role-specialized
internship management ecosystem.

## 1. Architectural Impact

### 1.1 Workspace Decomposition

The legacy `Dashboard` module is deprecated. Logic is split into:

- `Admin`: Global orchestration and data maintenance.
- `Student`: Journey management and journals.
- `Teacher`: Academic supervision.
- `Mentor`: Industry-side feedback.

### 1.2 Unified Assessment Logic

We are introducing the `Assessment` module to centralize grading algorithms.

- **Contract**: `AssessmentServiceInterface` will handle all scoring requests to ensure consistency
  across roles.

## 2. Implementation Keystones

### 2.1 PDF Reporting Engine

Integration of `laravel-dompdf` within the `Assessment` module.

- **Deliverable**: Automated **Certificate of Completion**.
- **Security**: Must include QR-code verification via **Signed URLs**.

### 2.2 RBAC Hardening

Every new workspace route must be protected by specific granular permissions.

- **Example**: `admin.view`, `teacher.supervise`.

---

## 3. QA & Artifact Sync Strategy

### 3.1 Verification

- **Testing**: Every new workspace component must have a Feature test covering both Success and
  Forbidden (403) states.
- **Security**: Manual audit of `Signed URL` expiration logic.

### 3.2 Documentation

- Update the **[Architecture Guide](../../main/architecture-guide.md)** to reflect the new role of
  the `app/` directory as an Infrastructure Module.

_This plan is closed. Future automation tasks are moved to the v0.7.x roadmap._
