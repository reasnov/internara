# Engineering Plan: v0.7.0 (Administrative Orchestration)

**Series Code**: `ARC01-ORCH-01`
**Status**: `Active`

---

## 1. Core Problem Statement

While basic tracking and role-based workspaces (v0.6.0) are functional, the system lacks **administrative leverage**. 
Admins currently rely on manual verification for internships, assessments, and operational monitoring. 
There is no automated enforcement of prerequisites, nor is there high-level visibility into system health or bulk operations.

**Goal**: This series transforms Internara from a "Passive Tracker" to an "Active Orchestrator" that enforces rules and provides operational intelligence.

## 2. Architectural Impact

### 2.1 Domain Expansion: Requirements & Validation
*   **New Domain Logic**: `InternshipRequirement` validation engine.
*   **Scope**: Abstracting "Conditions" (Documents, Skills, Boolean checks) into a polymorphic or driver-based validation layer within the `Internship` module.

### 2.2 Integration: Automated Grading Bridge
*   **Cross-Module Aggregation**: The `Assessment` module must now consume data from `Attendance` and `Journal` without hard coupling.
*   **Mechanism**: Service-to-Service communication via Contracts to pull "Compliance Scores" (e.g., Attendance Rate).

### 2.3 Infrastructure: System Visibility
*   **Global Notification Bridge**: Standardizing feedback via `mary-toast` across all modules (driven by `AppException` or `DomainEvents`).
*   **Batch Operations**: Introducing a monitoring interface for background jobs (Exports, ZIP generation).

## 3. Contract Definitions

| Contract | Owner Module | Consumer | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `RequirementValidator` | `Internship` | `Internship` | Standardizes how different requirement types (File, Skill) are verified. |
| `ComplianceAggregator` | `Assessment` | `Attendance`, `Journal` | Allows the grading engine to request participation metrics from operational modules. |
| `NotifierInterface` | `Core` | `Shared` | Decouples business logic from specific UI notification implementations (Toast). |

## 4. Exit Criteria

The v0.7.0 series is considered complete when:

- [ ] **Dynamic Prerequisites**: Admins can define requirements (CV, Permissions) that block internship applications until satisfied.
- [ ] **Auto-Grading**: Final grades can automatically factor in attendance percentages and journal submission rates.
- [ ] **Unified Stakeholder CRUD**: Students, Teachers, and Mentors can be managed via a centralized Admin interface.
- [ ] **JIT Mentorship**: Mentors can be created/assigned directly within the student placement modal (no context switching).
- [ ] **Operational Dashboard**: Admins have a view of system health (queue status, recent failures).

## 5. vNext Roadmap (v0.8.0)

*   **Reporting Engine**: Formalizing the `Report` module for complex, aggregated PDF analytics.
*   **Flexible Assignments**: decoupling strict "One-Internship-Per-Period" rules if needed.
*   **External API**: Potential need for external partners to push internship offers.
