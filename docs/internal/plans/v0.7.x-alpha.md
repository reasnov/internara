# Engineering Plan: v0.7.x (Administrative Orchestration)

**Series Code**: `ARC01-ORCH-01` **Status**: `In Progress`

After completing the foundational lifecycle in `v0.6.x`, version `v0.7.x` transitions from simple 
document automation to **Administrative Orchestration**. The focus is on ensuring data integrity 
through verified workflows and high-volume visibility.

## 1. Architectural Impact

### 1.1 Generic Requirement Engine
Expanding the `Internship` module to include an abstract prerequisite validation layer.
- **Model**: `InternshipRequirement` to define what is needed (Documents, Skills, or Conditions).
- **Model**: `RequirementSubmission` to store student proofs (File path, boolean state, or text).
- **Concern**: `HasRequirements` to orchestrate the validation of these dynamic prerequisites.

### 1.2 Automated Grading Bridge
Connecting the `Assessment` module with operational data from `Attendance` and `Journal`.
- **Contract**: `ComplianceService` to aggregate student participation metrics into scoring data.

### 1.3 System Notification & Batch Monitor
Improving visibility for background tasks and error handling.
- **System Notifications**: Integrating `AppException` with `mary-toast`.
- **Batch Monitor**: A UI layer for the `database` queue to track mass certificate/export jobs.

## 2. Production Keystones

### Keystone 1: Multidimensional Requirement Verification
Admins can define a diverse set of prerequisites that students must meet before placement.
- **Requirement Types**: 
    - **Document**: Requires file upload (e.g., CV, Parent Permit).
    - **Skill**: Requires self-assessment or score (e.g., "Basic PHP Knowledge").
    - **Condition**: Requires a boolean confirmation (e.g., "Willing to work on-site").
- **Eligibility**: The system automatically calculates "Placement Readiness" based on these 
  requirements.

### Keystone 2: Participation-Driven Assessment
Automatically calculating "Discipline" and "Activity" scores based on evidence.
- **Logic**: (Attendance Days / Expected Days) * Weight + (Approved Journals / Expected Journals) * 
  Weight.

### Keystone 3: Operational Heatmap & Anomaly Tracking
Real-time monitoring of attendance and journal compliance with anti-spam safeguards.

### Keystone 4: Administrative Job Console
A dedicated workspace for monitoring long-running batch operations (ZIPs, Exports).

## 3. QA & Artifact Sync Strategy

### 3.1 Verification
- **Dynamic Validation**: Ensuring the `HasRequirements` concern correctly validates different 
  input types (File vs Boolean vs Skill Rating).
