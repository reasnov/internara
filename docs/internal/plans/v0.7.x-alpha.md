# Engineering Plan: v0.7.x (Administrative Orchestration)

**Series Code**: `ARC01-FEAT-02` **Status**: `In Progress`

After completing the foundational lifecycle in `v0.6.x`, version `v0.7.x` transitions from simple 
document automation to **Administrative Orchestration**. The focus is on ensuring data integrity 
through verified workflows and high-volume visibility.

## 1. Architectural Impact

### 1.1 Placement & Requirement Engine
Expanding the `Internship` module to include prerequisite validation before matching.
- **Concern**: `HasRequirements` to handle document checklist states on student registrations.
- **Service**: `PlacementService` (Contract) to include validation logic for requirements.

### 1.2 Automated Grading Bridge
Connecting the `Assessment` module with operational data from `Attendance` and `Journal`.
- **Contract**: `ComplianceService` to aggregate student participation metrics into scoring data.

### 1.3 System Notification & Batch Monitor
Improving visibility for background tasks and error handling.
- **System Notifications**: Integrating `AppException` with `mary-toast`.
- **Batch Monitor**: A UI layer for the `database` queue to track mass certificate/export jobs.

## 2. Production Keystones

### Keystone 1: Verified Bulk Placement
Coordinators can only bulk-assign students who have cleared their administrative requirements.
- **Workflow**: Student uploads documents -> Admin verifies -> Student becomes "Eligible" for 
  Intelligent Matching.

### Keystone 2: Participation-Driven Assessment
Automatically calculating "Discipline" and "Activity" scores based on evidence.
- **Logic**: (Attendance Days / Expected Days) * Weight + (Approved Journals / Expected Journals) * 
  Weight.
- **Orchestration**: This score is injected into the `Assessment` form as a read-only baseline.

### Keystone 3: Operational Heatmap & Anomaly Tracking
Real-time monitoring of attendance and journal compliance.
- **Anti-Spam**: "Nudges" are only sent if anomalies exceed the 3-day threshold, following the 
  throttling rules.

### Keystone 4: Administrative Job Console
A dedicated workspace for monitoring long-running batch operations.
- **Features**: Progress bars for ZIP generation, failure alerts with `AppException` integration, 
  and "Retry" actions for failed exports.

---

## 3. QA & Artifact Sync Strategy

### 3.1 Verification
- **Cross-Module Validation**: Ensuring the `Assessment` module correctly pulls data from 
  `Attendance` via the `ComplianceService` contract.
- **Queue Transparency**: Verifying that failed background jobs trigger the correct UI 
  notifications via `mary-toast`.
