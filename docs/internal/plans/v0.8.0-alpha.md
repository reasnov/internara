# Engineering Plan: v0.8.0 (Reporting & Intelligence)

**Series Code**: `ARC01-INTEL-01` **Status**: `Planned`

---

## 1. Core Problem Statement

While v0.7.0 successfully automated data collection and basic compliance, the system currently lacks
**high-level analytical synthesis**. Stakeholders (Principals, Department Heads, and Industry
Partners) need aggregated reports rather than raw data views.

Furthermore, the current "One-Student-One-Placement" model is too rigid for institutions requiring
**rotational internships** or multiple placement history tracking.

**Goal**: Transform Internara from an "Orchestrator" to an "Intelligence Platform" capable of
complex reporting and flexible assignment modeling.

## 2. Architectural Impact

### 2.1 Domain: Aggregated Reporting Engine (`modules/Report`)

- **New Module**: A dedicated `Report` module to handle asynchronous PDF generation.
- **Strategy**: Use of **Read Models** or temporary aggregation tables to prevent heavy SQL queries
  from slowing down the primary operational database during report generation.
- **Scope**: Class-wide performance summaries, Industry Partner engagement metrics, and National
  Compliance exports.

### 2.2 Domain: Flexible Placement History

- **Refactor**: Modify the `Internship` module to support a "History of Placements" instead of a
  single active ID.
- **Impact**: Enables students to participate in multiple short-term placements or "Rotation Magang"
  within a single academic period.

### 2.3 UI: Analytical Dashboards

- **Feature**: Introduction of visual data summaries (Charts/Stats) for Administrators to identify
  "at-risk" students (low attendance/journal activity) across the entire institution at a glance.

## 3. Contract Definitions

| Contract                 | Owner Module | Consumer     | Purpose                                                                                                              |
| :----------------------- | :----------- | :----------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `ExportableDataContract` | `Shared`     | All Modules  | A standard interface for any module to provide structured datasets to the Reporting Engine.                          |
| `PlacementStrategy`      | `Internship` | `Internship` | Allows switching between "Single Placement" and "Rotational/Sequential" placement logic without breaking core flows. |
| `AnalyticsProvider`      | `Core`       | `Admin`      | Provides pre-aggregated institutional metrics (e.g. Total Active Interns, Partner Capacity Fill Rate).               |

## 4. Exit Criteria

The v0.8.0 series is considered complete when:

- [ ] **Class-Level Reporting**: Teachers can generate a single, comprehensive PDF report for their
      entire supervised class in one click.
- [ ] **Partner Analytics**: Admins can view engagement reports (responsiveness, number of interns
      mentored, average feedback scores) per Industry Partner.
- [ ] **Placement Rotation**: The system successfully supports assigning a student to a second
      placement after the first one is completed/terminated.
- [ ] **Performance Benchmarking**: The reporting engine can generate a 50+ page document (for large
      cohorts) asynchronously via the queue without HTTP timeouts.

---

## 5. vNext Roadmap (v0.9.0)

- **Public API & Integration**: Preparing for External School Systems (SIS) integration.
- **Mobile-First Experience**: Transitioning student journals to a dedicated mobile-optimized
  interface or PWA.
- **Enhanced Audit Logs**: Expanding the tracking of administrative changes for higher
  accountability.
