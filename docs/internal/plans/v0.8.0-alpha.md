# Engineering Plan: v0.8.0 (Reporting & Intelligence)

**Series Code**: `ARC01-INTEL-01` (Provisional)
**Status**: `Planned`

---

## 1. Core Problem Statement

While v0.7.0 ensures data is collected and rules are enforced, the system lacks **high-level analytical output**. 
Stakeholders (Schools, Partners) need aggregated insights, not just row-by-row data. 
Additionally, the current assignment model is rigid, assuming a linear "One Student, One Placement" flow that may not match complex academic needs.

**Goal**: Transform Internara from an "Orchestrator" to an "Intelligence Platform" capable of complex reporting and flexible assignment modeling.

## 2. Architectural Impact

### 2.1 Domain: Reporting Engine
*   **New Module**: `Report` (or expansion of `Admin`).
*   **Scope**: Asynchronous generation of complex PDFs (Aggregated Class Reports, Partner Activity Summaries).
*   **Performance**: Offloading heavy aggregations to Read Models or Cached Materialized Views if necessary.

### 2.2 Domain: Flexible Placements
*   **Refactor**: `Internship` module to support concurrent or sequential placements (if academic rules allow).
*   **Logic**: Decoupling the "Active Internship" check to allow for "History of Placements".

## 3. Contract Definitions

| Contract | Owner Module | Consumer | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `ReportDataProvider` | `Report` | All Domains | Standard interface for modules to expose exportable datasets without exposing models. |
| `PlacementStrategy` | `Internship` | `Internship` | Strategy pattern to handle different allocation rules (First-Come, competitive, Assigned). |

---

## 4. Exit Criteria

The v0.8.0 series is considered complete when:

- [ ] **Class-Level Reporting**: Teachers can download a single PDF summarizing the status of their entire class.
- [ ] **Partner Performance**: Admins can view analytics on which industry partners are most active/responsive.
- [ ] **Flexible Assignment**: The system supports "Rotation" style internships (multiple placements per period) if configured.

## 5. vNext Roadmap (v0.9.0)

*   **Public API**: Opening data access for external school systems (SIS integration).
*   **Mobile App**: Potential API-first approach for student journal entry.
