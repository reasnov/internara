# Engineering Plan: v0.8.x (Flexible Assignment & Final Reporting)

**Series Code**: `ARC01-ASSG-01`
**Status**: `Planned`

Following the administrative orchestration in `v0.7.x`, version `v0.8.x` introduces a robust **Assignment Engine**. This allows administrators and teachers to define flexible deliverables—such as Final Reports, Presentation Slides, or Project Demos—that students must submit to complete their internship.

## 1. Architectural Impact

### 1.1 New Module: `Assignment`
A dedicated module to handle task definitions, submissions, and grading.
- **Model**: `AssignmentTask` (The definition: Title, Description, Due Date, Type).
- **Model**: `AssignmentSubmission` (The student's work: File Path/URL, Submission Date).
- **Service**: `AssignmentService` to orchestrate distribution and collection.

### 1.2 Flexible Task Engine
The system will support dynamic task configurations similar to the Requirement Engine but focused on *outputs* rather than *prerequisites*.
- **Scope**: Tasks can be assigned Globally (per Internship Program) or Contextually (per Placement/School).
- **Submission Types**: 
    - **File**: PDF, DOCX, PPTX, ZIP (via MediaLibrary).
    - **Link**: External URLs (Google Drive, YouTube, GitHub).

### 1.3 Review & Iteration Loop
Unlike simple requirements, assignments require a feedback loop.
- **Workflow**: `Assigned` -> `Submitted` -> `Under Review` -> `Revision Requested` -> `Approved`.
- **Feedback**: Supervisors (Teachers/Mentors) can attach comments to submissions.

## 2. Production Keystones

### Keystone 1: The Assignment Engine
Building the core backend structure for defining and distributing tasks.
- **CRUD**: Interface for Admins/Teachers to create tasks.
- **Targeting**: Logic to assign tasks to specific cohorts (e.g., "All students in 2025/2026 Program").

### Keystone 2: Student Workspace - "My Deliverables"
A dedicated section in the Student Dashboard to manage deadlines and submissions.
- **UI**: Kanban or List view of pending vs. completed tasks.
- **Action**: Upload interface with support for revisions.

### Keystone 3: Supervisor Review Console
A grading interface for Teachers and Mentors.
- **Feature**: Side-by-side view of the student's file/link and the grading form.
- **Logic**: Integration with the `Assessment` module to contribute to the final grade (optional).

## 3. QA & Verification Strategy

### 3.1 Scenario Testing
- **Late Submission**: Verify behavior when a student submits after the due date.
- **Revision Flow**: Ensure students can re-submit only when requested.
- **File Security**: Validate that only authorized supervisors can download student files.
