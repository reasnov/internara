# Advanced Engineering: Extending Internara

This directory contains documentation for advanced development scenarios, architectural extensions,
and complex customizations. These guides are intended for senior developers who need to evolve the
system's core or build highly specialized domain modules.

## 1. Advanced Guides Index

### 1.1 [Custom Module Scaffolding](custom-module-generator.md)

Explains how to override the default Laravel Modules generators to enforce Internara's specific
directory structure and strict-typing rules.

### 1.2 Performance & Caching (Roadmap)

Future guide on optimizing modular auto-discovery and hydration cycles in high-traffic environments.

## 2. When to Use Advanced Guides

Refer to these documents only after you have mastered the
**[Core Architecture](../architecture-guide.md)** and standard
**[Development Workflow](../development-workflow.md)**.

### Best Practices:

- **Pragmatic Minimalism**: Only use advanced patterns if the standard conventions are insufficient
  for the business requirement.
- **Maintainability First**: Advanced customizations must be fully documented and covered by
  comprehensive tests.

_The goal of our advanced engineering is to make the system more resilient and automated, never more
complex for complexity's sake._
