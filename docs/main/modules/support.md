# Support Module

The `Support` module acts as a bridge between the Laravel framework, third-party packages, and the Internara application. It is used for infrastructure integrations that are specific to the project's requirements but don't belong in the core business logic.

## Purpose

-   **Integration:** Wraps and configures third-party libraries for modular use.
-   **Abstraction:** Provides a clean interface for infrastructure-heavy tasks.
-   **Decoupling:** Prevents domain modules from depending directly on complex external implementations.

## Key Features

-   **Infrastructure Providers:** Registers project-wide service providers for external packages.
-   **Third-Party Wrappers:** Contains specific configurations or classes that adapt external tools to Internara's standards.
