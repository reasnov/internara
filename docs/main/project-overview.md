## 1. Vision & Purpose

### The Vision

To deliver a **minimalist, highly structured, and resilient** platform for vocational internship
(PKL) governance. Internara prioritizes ease of use and reliability, ensuring that the system
remains effective even as the number of users grows.

### The Problem Space

Vocational internships often suffer from a "visibility gap." student progress is tracked via
fragmented manual logs, and assessments are often subjective or delayed. Internara provides:

- **Integrated Administration**: Centralized data for students, schedules, and locations.
- **Continuous Monitoring**: Real-time tracking of student progress and competency achievements.
- **Evidence-Based Evaluation**: Documented mentoring activities and learning outcomes.

---

## 2. Key Features

- **Administrative Management**: Record student data, schedules, and practical work locations.
- **Progress Monitoring**: Track competency achievements and student conditions on-site.
- **Mentoring & Evaluation**: Document mentoring sessions and generate competency reports.
- **Mobile-First Design**: Accessible via desktop, tablet, and mobile devices.
- **Multi-Language Support**: Fully localized in **Indonesian (Primary)** and **English**.

---

## 3. User Roles

Internara provides dedicated workspaces for:

- **Instructors**: Monitor student progress, record mentoring content, and generate reports.
- **Practical Work Staff**: Manage schedules, locations, and administrative documents.
- **Students**: View competency achievements, schedules, and review mentoring content.
- **Industry Supervisors**: Provide real-time feedback and mentoring documentation.

---

## 4. Visual Identity

Internara follows a modern, professional aesthetic:

- **Typography**: Primary font is **Instrument Sans**.
- **Theming**: Supports both **Light** and **Dark** modes.
- **Accent**: **Emerald Green** (representing growth and precision).
- **Interface**: Minimalist, responsive, and aligned with educational standards.

---

## 5. Technology Foundation

Internara is built on the **TALL Stack**, chosen for speed, reactivity, and reliability:

- **Laravel v12**: The backbone of the application's business logic.
- **Livewire v3**: Powers the interactive, reactive user interface.
- **Alpine.js v4**: Handles smooth client-side interactions.
- **Tailwind CSS v4**: The utility-first design engine.
