## 1. Vision & Purpose

### The Vision

To deliver a **minimalist, highly structured, and resilient** platform for vocational internship
(PKL) governance. Internara prioritizes ease of use and reliability, ensuring that the system
remains effective even as the number of users grows.

### The Problem Space

Vocational internships often suffer from a "visibility gap." Placements are frequently mismanaged,
student progress is tracked via fragmented manual logs, and assessments are often subjective or
delayed. This can lead to a loss of academic legitimacy.

Internara solves this by providing:

- **Integrated Planning**: Centralized placement and requirement management.
- **Continuous Observation**: Real-time daily journals and attendance tracking.
- **Evidence-Based Evaluation**: Structured assessments mapped to specific competency indicators.

## 2. Key Features

- **End-to-End Lifecycle**: Manages everything from registration and daily logs to final grading and
  certification.
- **Role-Based Workspaces**: Dedicated environments for Admins, Students, Teachers, and Industry
  Mentors.
- **Administrative Automation**: Intelligent requirement verification and automated
  participation-driven scoring.
- **Secure by Design**: Built with modern security standards to protect institutional and student
  data.
- **Multi-Language Support**: Fully accessible in both **English** and **Indonesian**.

## 3. Technology Foundation

Internara is built on the **TALL Stack**, a modern set of technologies chosen for speed, reactivity,
and reliability:

- **Laravel**: The world-class PHP framework providing the application's backbone.
- **Livewire**: Powers the interactive, app-like user interface.
- **Tailwind CSS**: Ensures a clean, consistent, and professional visual design.
- **Alpine.js**: Handles smooth client-side interactions.

- **[Installation Guide](installation-guide.md)**: How to set up and run Internara.
- **[Versions Overview](../versions/versions-overview.md)**: Release history and support status.

### 🛠 Internal Manuals (`docs/internal/`)

Detailed technical specifications for developers and contributors.

- **[Architecture Guide](../internal/architecture-guide.md)**: Deep-dive into the system's inner
