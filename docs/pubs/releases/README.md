improvements, and what to expect in each version.

## 1. How We Track Progress

We use simple labels to let you know the readiness and maintenance level of each version. Internara
follows **Strict SemVer** syntax (e.g., `v0.13.0`).

### Readiness

- **Development**: Initial development phase (`0.x.y`). System is inherently unstable.
- **Alpha**: Early testing phase. New features are being added rapidly.
- **Beta**: Feature complete. Focusing on fixing bugs and polishing the experience.
- **Release Candidate (RC)**: Final validation phase. Stable enough for evaluation, pending final
  sign-off.
- **Stable**: Production-ready. Verified baseline ready for everyday use in your institution.

### Support Policy

- **Experimental**: Active development. No stability guarantees; not recommended for production.
- **Stable/LTS**: Long-term support. Guaranteed reliability and critical updates for a defined
  period.
- **Maintenance**: Actively maintained with regular improvements and security fixes.
- **Security Only**: Critical fixes only. No new features or general bug fixes will be provided.
- **End of Life (EOL)**: No longer supported. Institutions must upgrade to a newer version
  immediately.
