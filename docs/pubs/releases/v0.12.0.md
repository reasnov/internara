# Release Note: v0.12.0 — Timeline Transparency & Guidance

**Series Code:** ARC01-GAP | **Support Policy:** Experimental | **Readiness:** Alpha

---

## 🚀 Overview

Version **v0.12.0** is designed to answer the two most common questions in any internship
program: _"When is the deadline?"_ and _"What do I need to prepare?"_.

We are introducing a **Centralized Scheduling System** and a **Digital Guidance Hub** to ensure
complete transparency. This update bridges the communication gap between schools and students,
ensuring every participant knows exactly where they are in their internship journey.
