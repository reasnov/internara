**Series Code:** ARC01-FIX-01 | **Support:** Snapshot | **Status:** In Development

---

## 🚀 Overview

Version **v0.13.0** marks the transition from feature construction to system stabilization. This release is dedicated to resolving accumulated defects, optimizing performance, and hardening the system security in preparation for the upcoming **Beta** milestone.

---

## ✨ Key Features

### 🛡️ Multi-Layered Security System
*Stricter form security and data access control.*

- **Automated Bot Defense:** Integrated Cloudflare Turnstile and a "Honeypot" system to ensure only real humans can interact with registration and login forms.
- **Gatekeeper (Rate Limiter):** Throttles repeated authentication attempts to prevent brute-force attacks.
- **Access Integrity:** Implementation of temporary Signed URLs for high-privilege administrative actions.

### 🔒 Data Privacy Protection
*Distributed encryption and forensic masking.*

- **Database Encryption:** Systemic protection of PII fields (Phone, Address, NISN, NIP, Bio) at the persistence layer.
- **Information Redaction:** Automated masking of sensitive identifiers in system logs and administrative views.

### 🔑 Smart Password Policy
- **Adaptive Complexity:** Environment-aware validation rules that escalate security requirements in Production while remaining developer-friendly in Local environments.

### 🧪 Memory-Efficient Testing
- **Modular Orchestrator:** Introduction of the `app:test` command for sequential module verification, ensuring stability in memory-constrained environments.

### 📡 Dual-Path Notification System
- **Unified Dispatching:** Systematic separation between transient UI feedback (Toasts) and persistent external alerts (Email/Database).

### 🛡️ Attribution & Integrity Guard
*Protecting the original author's rights and system metadata.*

- **Multi-Layered Verification:** Implemented a robust integrity check at the Bootstrap, Service, and Helper levels to prevent unauthorized modifications of application metadata and author attribution.
- **Metadata SSoT:** Established `app_info.json` as the Single Source of Truth for core application information, ensuring consistency across all system modules.

### 🎨 Advanced UI Experience
*Polished layouts and cinematic motion.*

- **Tiered Layout System:** Standardized UI architecture into three distinct layers (Base, Page, and Component) for better maintainability and visual coherence.
- **Cinematic Motion (AOS):** Integrated Animate On Scroll (AOS) to provide smooth, professional transitions that guide the user's attention throughout the application.
- **Dynamic Identity Separation:** Clearly separated Product Identity (`app_name`) from Instance Identity (`brand_name`), allowing schools to customize their branding while maintaining product attribution.
