---

## 🚀 Overview

Version **v0.13.0** marks the transition from feature construction to rigorous system stabilization.
This release is dedicated to resolving accumulated defects, optimizing performance, and hardening
the system security to establish a robust and reliable alpha baseline.

## ✨ Key Features

### 🛡️ Multi-Layered Security System

_Stricter form security and data access control._

- **Automated Bot Defense:** Integrated Cloudflare Turnstile and a "Honeypot" system to ensure only
  real humans can interact with registration and login forms.
- **Gatekeeper (Rate Limiter):** Throttles repeated authentication attempts to prevent brute-force
  attacks.
- **Access Integrity:** Implementation of temporary Signed URLs for high-privilege administrative
  actions.

### 🔒 Data Privacy Protection

_Distributed encryption and forensic masking._

- **Database Encryption:** Systemic protection of PII fields (Phone, Address, NISN, NIP, Bio) at the
  persistence layer.
- **Information Redaction:** Automated masking of sensitive identifiers in system logs and
  administrative views.

### 🔑 Smart Password Policy

- **Adaptive Complexity:** Environment-aware validation rules that escalate security requirements in
  Production while remaining developer-friendly in Local environments.

### 🧪 Memory-Efficient Testing

- **Sub-segment Orchestration:** Enhanced the `app:test` command to execute `Unit`, `Feature`, and
  `Browser` tests sequentially for every module, ensuring optimal memory heap management and
  preventing leaks.
- **Granular Control:** Introduced new flags (`--no-unit`, `--no-feature`, `--no-browser`) to allow
  developers to skip specific testing segments during high-frequency development cycles.
- **Detailed Intelligence:** The test summary table now provides precise execution durations for
  each sub-segment and module, along with total execution time and peak memory usage reporting.

### 📡 Robust Notification System

- **Unified Dispatching:** Implemented a global `notify()` helper that intelligently handles both
  real-time Livewire events and standard session-flashed messages, ensuring feedback is never lost
  after redirects.
- **Native Toast Engine:** Developed a custom, high-fidelity notification engine using AlpineJS and
  Tailwind, replacing external dependencies for a more cinematic and predictable user experience.

### 🤖 Universal AI Agent Infrastructure

- **Agentic Workflows:** Formalized 10 distinct engineering lifecycles (Planning to Maintenancing)
  in the universal `docs/agents/` directory, ensuring consistent and traceable AI-driven
  development.
- **Documentation SSoT:** Established a rigorous "Docs-as-Code" synchronization workflow that
  prohibits content truncation and mandates analytical PHPDocs for all service contracts.

### 🛡️ Attribution & Integrity Guard

_Protecting the original author's rights and system metadata._

- **Multi-Layered Verification:** Implemented a robust integrity check at the Bootstrap, Service,
  and Helper levels to prevent unauthorized modifications of application metadata and author
  attribution.
- **Metadata SSoT:** Established `app_info.json` as the Single Source of Truth for core application
  information, ensuring consistency across all system modules.

### 🎨 Advanced UI Experience

_Polished layouts and cinematic motion._

- **Tiered Layout System:** Standardized UI architecture into three distinct layers (Base, Page, and
  Component) for better maintainability and visual coherence.
- **Cinematic Motion (AOS):** Integrated Animate On Scroll (AOS) across all core components to
  provide smooth, professional transitions that guide the user's attention.
- **Comprehensive i18n Refactor:** Completed a system-wide refactoring of the frontend to ensure
  100% localization (ID/EN) compliance, removing all hardcoded strings from over 20 modules.
- **Accessibility (A11y) Standard:** Enforced strict WCAG 2.1 compliance by adding ARIA labels,
  roles, and optimizing touch targets across the entire component library.
- **Zero-Coupling UI:** Successfully decoupled Blade views from business logic by migrating direct
  service calls to Livewire Computed Properties and class-based components.

## 🛠 What's Changed?

### Added

- **Metadata SSoT**: Introduced `MetadataService` in the `Core` module as the authoritative source
  for application identity and author verification.
- **Localization Service**: Centralized locale management in the `UI` module, ensuring strict
  adherence to the "Thin Component" mandate for the Language Switcher.
- **New UI Components**: Introduced `x-ui::stat` for standardized metric visualization and enhanced
  `x-ui::avatar` with better placeholder support.
- **Mandatory Quality Gate**: Integrated `composer test` as a standard verification step in the
  engineering lifecycle, documented in the Testing Guide.
- **Universal Agent Workflows**: Formalized and documented 10 engineering lifecycles in the
  `docs/agents/workflows/` directory to standardize AI-assisted development.
- **Browser Stability Layer**: Added global browser arguments (`--no-sandbox`, etc.) to the testing
  baseline to ensure stability in Linux and virtualized environments.

### Changed

- **Architectural Re-alignment**: Reconstructed all **Application Blueprints** (ARC01 series) to
  reflect the complete project roadmap from Genesis to current.
- **Directory Standardization**: Migrated all remaining `Traits` directories to `Concerns` and
  relocated technical utilities to `Support` or `Functions` according to new conventions.
- **Enhanced Testing CLI**: Refactored `app:test` to support sequential sub-segment execution and
  provide high-fidelity summary tables with duration tracking.
- **Service Layer Optimization**: Refactored domain services (`UserService`, `OnboardingService`,
  `ProfileService`, etc.) to improve isolation and utilize standardized `EloquentQuery` patterns.
- **Refined Exception Handling**: Updated `HandlesAppException` to utilize localized keys and
  enforced secure error abstraction for production environments.

### Fixed

- **Illegal Instruction (SIGILL) Resilience**: Implemented `try-catch` blocks and process signaling
  protection in the test orchestrator to handle CPU/Sandbox incompatibilities gracefully.
- **Pest Framework Scoping**: Resolved an issue in `tests/Pest.php` where modular tests were not
  correctly extending the base `TestCase` due to restrictive glob patterns.
- **Normalization Logic**: Fixed redundant slash handling in `Formatter` for both file system paths
  and PHP namespaces.
- **Onboarding Integrity**: Corrected `OnboardingService` to interact with domain models exclusively
  via Service Contracts, preserving modular isolation.
