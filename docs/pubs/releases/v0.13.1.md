# Release Notes: v0.13.1 — System Stabilization Refinement

**Series Code**: `ARC01-FIX` | **Support Policy**: `Experimental` | **Readiness**: `Alpha`

---

## 1. Overview

This release focuses on **System Stabilization and Invariant Enforcement**, resolving technical
desynchronization between documentation and implementation. It hardens the foundational
infrastructure to ensure 100% compliance with the **Internara Engineering Standards**.

---

## 2. Key Features

### 🛡️ Architectural Hardening

- **Strict UUID Invariant**: The `User` model now enforces UUID v4 identification as a non-negotiable
  architectural rule, eliminating conditional configuration dependencies.
- **Environment Helper Restructuring**: Global environment helpers have been refactored into a
  "one-function-per-file" structure (`is_testing()`, `is_development()`, `is_maintenance()`) to
  satisfy modular organization standards.
- **Service Layer Refinement**: Enhanced `EloquentQuery` with robust, PII-masked logging for bulk
  operations.

### 🌐 Internationalization (i18n) & UX

- **Localization Completeness**: Eliminated all hard-coded UI feedback in the `User` module.
- **Localized Data Formatting**: Integrated `Formatter::date()` for consistent, narrative date
  presentation across management interfaces.

## 3. What's Changed? (Changelog)

### Added

- **Quality Gate**: Added `phpstan/phpstan` to the development baseline for Level 8 static analysis.

### Changed

- **Version Synchronization**: Unified project version metadata across `app_info.json`,
  `composer.json`, and `package.json`.
- **Logging Discipline**: All debug logs are now strictly guarded by the `is_debug_mode()` check.

### Fixed

- **PII Protection**: Resolved a potential information leak in bulk data ingestion logs.
- **Documentation Accuracy**: Synchronized the Engineering Index to reflect the actual location of
  system traits and service contracts.

_This release ensures that Internara's foundation is technically disciplined and ready for
institutional-grade deployment._
