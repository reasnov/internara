# Release Note: v0.13.1 — UI Refinement & Notification Overhaul

**Series Code:** ARC01-FIX-01 | **Support Policy:** Experimental | **Readiness:** Development

---

## 🚀 Overview

Version **v0.13.1** is a maintenance release focused on streamlining the User Interface (UI) by
removing redundant animation libraries and transitioning to a robust, standardized notification
system using PHPFlasher.

---

## ✨ Key Features

### 📡 Standardized Notification System (PHPFlasher Integration)

- **PHPFlasher Overhaul**: Migrated from a custom `notify()` helper and `NotificationBridge` to the
  industry-standard `php-flasher/flasher-laravel`.
- **Unified Feedback**: Standardized all success, error, warning, and info alerts across all modules
  (Admin, Attendance, Auth, Internship, etc.) to use a consistent, high-performance notification
  engine.
- **Theme Synchronization**: Automatically synchronizes notification styles with the application's
  light and dark modes for a seamless visual experience.
- **Improved Reliability**: Resolved issues where notifications were occasionally lost during
  Livewire `wire:navigate` transitions or multiple simultaneous events.

### 🎨 Visual & Performance Optimization

- **AOS Removal**: Completely removed the "Animate On Scroll" (AOS) library and its associated
  attributes to reduce bundle size and improve rendering performance.
- **UI Simplification**: Eliminated redundant `data-aos` attributes from all Blade components,
  resulting in cleaner DOM structures and more predictable layout behavior.
- **Streamlined Components**: Removed the legacy `ui::toast` and `ui::notification-bridge`
  components in favor of the more capable PHPFlasher integration.
- **Language Switcher Refinement**: Replaced the custom dropdown language switcher with a native
  `select` element for better accessibility and consistent behavior across devices.

## 🛠 What's Changed?

### Added

- **PHPFlasher**: Added `php-flasher/flasher-laravel` as the primary notification provider.
- **Theme Sync**: Implemented a theme watcher to ensure PHPFlasher's appearance matches the current
  system theme (Light/Dark).

### Changed

- **Notification Helper**: Refactored the `notify()` helper in the `Notification` module to act as a
  wrapper for `flash()`, maintaining backward compatibility while leveraging the new engine.
- **Livewire Integration**: Updated all Livewire components to use `flash()` directly for feedback,
  improving code clarity and maintainability.
- **Component Props**: Removed the unused `aos` property from all UI components.

### Fixed

- **Attendance Feedback**: Fixed an issue where attendance recording feedback was not reliably
  displayed due to legacy event-based notification dispatching.
- **Slot Manager Stability**: Improved the stability of Livewire components rendered through the
  `SlotManager` by ensuring consistent, MD5-hashed stable IDs.

### Removed

- **AOS Library**: Removed `aos` dependency from `package.json` and CSS/JS entry points.
- **Legacy Toast Component**: Deleted `modules/UI/resources/views/components/toast.blade.php`.
- **Notification Bridge**: Deleted `modules/UI/src/Livewire/NotificationBridge.php`.
