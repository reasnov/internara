**Series Code:** ARC01-FIX-01 | **Support Policy:** Experimental | **Readiness:** Development

---

## 🚀 Overview

Version **v0.13.1** is a critical maintenance release focused on hardening the system's security
posture and refining the User Experience (UX). This update addresses several security
vulnerabilities related to PII leakage and access control, while simultaneously optimizing asset
delivery and visual feedback mechanisms.

## ✨ Key Features

### 🛡️ Security Hardening (Manual & Automated Audit Findings)

- **PII Leakage Prevention**: Sanitized system logs and exception handlers to prevent sensitive
    information (Email, Username, Database internals) from being written to disk during registration
    or database failures.
- **Access Control Reinforcement**: Hardened the `AuthService` registration logic to prevent
    unauthorized role escalation via request manipulation.
- **Stronger Password Generation**: Upgraded the default password generator to utilize high-entropy
    randomization for system-created accounts.
- **Dependency Patching**:
    - Patched **Axios (CVE-2024-XXXX)**: Resolved a High severity Denial of Service vulnerability
      via `__proto__` key.
    - Patched **PsySH (CVE-2026-25129)**: Resolved a Medium severity Local Privilege Escalation
      vulnerability.

### 🎨 Visual & Performance Optimization

- **Glassmorphic Toast UI**: Redesigned notifications with `backdrop-blur-xl` and `bg-base-100/60`,
  moving away from heavy semantic backgrounds for a cleaner, modern aesthetic.
- **Branded Visual Preloader**: Introduced a sophisticated preloader that features the institutional
  logo and a dual-spinner design, ensuring a professional entry experience while assets load.
- **AOS Polish**: Optimized "Animate On Scroll" (AOS) transitions to prevent text blurring and
  ensure smoother interactions during SPA navigation.
- **Smart Asset Caching**: Implemented rigorous browser caching rules for fonts and static assets,
  significantly reducing server load.

### 📡 Notification System Stability

- **SPA-Aware Notifications**: Enhanced the Toast engine to capture global browser events reliably
  during `wire:navigate` transitions and handle queued session alerts pro-actively.
- **Welcome Onboarding**: Integrated personalized welcome notifications for both Login and Student
  Registration flows.

## 🛠 What's Changed?

### Added

- **Composer Check**: Added `composer check` script for rapid system integrity and configuration
  validation.
- **Font Caching**: Added `Expires` and `Cache-Control` headers for `.woff2` and other static assets
  in `.htaccess`.
- **Preloader Component**: Created `x-ui::layouts.base.preloader` for centralized loading state
  management.

### Changed

- **Notification Bridge**: Refactored the event bridge to resolve naming conflicts and support
  multiple simultaneous alerts.
- **Toast Logic**: Implemented high-entropy ID generation and improved transition lifecycle to
  ensure reliable rendering.
- **Developer Experience (DX)**: Normalized `app_info.json` and established Composer as the primary
  project orchestrator.

### Fixed

- **Logo Resolution**: Resolved an issue where the brand logo failed to appear in the Setup Wizard
  due to relative path resolution.
- **Component Discovery**: Fixed `MethodNotFoundException` by explicitly registering Livewire
  components for domain-isolated modules.
- **Browser Testing Compatibility**: Switched from Playwright back to Laravel Dusk to maintain
  environment stability.
- **Setup Wizard UX**: Fixed a bug where the "Create Account" button provided no feedback during
  validation failures.
