---

## 🚀 Overview

Version **v0.13.1** is a significant update focusing on professionalizing the User Experience (UX),
enhancing architectural stability, and completing the transition to a high-performance
notification and navigation system.

---

## ✨ Key Features

### 🎨 Advanced Layout & Navigation

-   **Independent Scrolling**: Implemented separate scroll containers for the sidebar and main
    content, providing a more ergonomic browsing experience in data-heavy modules.
-   **Sidemap (Breadcrumbs)**: Introduced a context-aware navigation path (e.g., `Internara > Student Management`) above page headers to improve user orientation and reduce visual redundancy.
-   **Sidebar Grouping**: Organized the Admin sidebar into logical categories (**Core**,
    **Management**, **Intelligence**, and **System**) using the new `x-ui::menu-separator`
    component.
-   **Visual Hierarchy**: Drastically improved interface depth by implementing a 3-tier background
    system (`base-100` for cards, `base-200` for sidebar, and `base-300` for the page canvas).

### 👥 Contextual Stakeholder Management

-   **Intelligent UserManager**: Refactored the unified user management system to be fully
    contextual. When managing Students, the UI now displays student-specific titles, labels, and
    forms.
-   **SuperAdmin Hardening**: Protected the SuperAdmin account from being edited or deleted via
    standard management interfaces, ensuring system integrity.
-   **Dedicated User Settings**: Introduced a "Settings" menu for SuperAdmins to manage their own
    security credentials (Email & Password) directly from the navbar.

### 📡 System Stability & Fixes

-   **Slot Rendering Fix**: Resolved a critical issue in `SlotManager` where components with unique
    IDs were failing to render. Migrated to `x-dynamic-component` for robust slot injection.
-   **Turnstile Resiliency**: Made Cloudflare Turnstile rendering and validation conditional,
    preventing JavaScript crashes in environments where the service is not configured.
-   **Table Optimization**: Improved table rendering by removing forced full-width constraints,
    allowing tables to shrink-to-fit their content for a more compact and readable look.
-   **Badge Refinement**: Added support for standard semantic variants (`warning`, `error`,
    `success`, `info`) and fixed text overflow issues.

## 🛠 What's Changed?

### Added

-   **Components**: `x-ui::menu-separator` and `x-ui::menu-sub` for advanced sidebar organization.
-   **Layout**: `bodyClass` support in the base layout for conditional page-level styling.

### Changed

-   **PHPFlasher**: Fully integrated `php-flasher/flasher-laravel` across all modules (Admin,
    Attendance, Auth, etc.).
-   **Localization**: Completed i18n support for all core management titles and sidebar labels.
-   **Assignment Seeder**: Localized default assignment types into Indonesian.

### Fixed

-   **Redundant Titles**: Removed automatic H1 from the dashboard layout to prevent title stacking
    with page components.
-   **At-Risk Widget**: Removed the distracting red border on the "At-Risk Students" card in dark
    mode.
-   **UserManager Stability**: Restored missing `ManagesRecords` properties and resolved
    `PropertyNotFoundException`.
