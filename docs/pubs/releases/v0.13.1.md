**Series Code:** ARC01-FIX-01 | **Support Policy:** Experimental | **Readiness:** Development

---

## 🚀 Overview

Version **v0.13.1** is a critical maintenance release focused on hardening the system's security
posture and refining the User Experience (UX). This update addresses several security
vulnerabilities related to PII leakage and access control, while simultaneously optimizing asset
delivery and visual feedback mechanisms.

## ✨ Key Features

### 🛡️ Security Hardening (Manual & Automated Audit Findings)



- **PII Leakage Prevention**: Sanitized system logs and exception handlers to prevent sensitive

  information (Email, Username, Database internals) from being written to disk during registration or

  database failures.

- **Access Control Reinforcement**: Hardened the `AuthService` registration logic to prevent

  unauthorized role escalation via request manipulation.

- **Stronger Password Generation**: Upgraded the default password generator to utilize high-entropy

  randomization for system-created accounts.

- **Dependency Patching**: 

    - Patched **Axios (CVE-2024-XXXX)**: Resolved a High severity Denial of Service vulnerability via `__proto__` key.

    - Patched **PsySH (CVE-2026-25129)**: Resolved a Medium severity Local Privilege Escalation vulnerability.

### 🎨 Visual & Performance Optimization

- **Branded Visual Preloader**: Introduced a sophisticated preloader that features the institutional
  logo and a dual-spinner design, ensuring a professional entry experience while assets load.
- **Smart Asset Caching**: Implemented rigorous browser caching rules for fonts and static assets,
  significantly reducing server load and improving subsequent page load speeds.
- **Cinematic Motion (AOS) Polish**: Refined "Animate On Scroll" (AOS) transitions across the setup
  wizard and core components for smoother, more natural interactions.

### 📡 Notification System Stability

- **SPA-Aware Notifications**: Enhanced the Toast notification engine to maintain persistence during
  Livewire SPA transitions and capture global browser events reliably.

## 🛠 What's Changed?

### Added

- **Font Caching**: Added `Expires` and `Cache-Control` headers for `.woff2` and other static assets
  in `.htaccess`.
- **Preloader Component**: Created `x-ui::layouts.base.preloader` for centralized loading state
  management.
- **Performance Hints**: Added `preconnect` and `dns-prefetch` to the base layout head.

### Changed

- **Versioning Standard**: Normalized `app_info.json` to store raw version strings (e.g., `0.13.1`),
  improving metadata flexibility.
- **Developer Experience (DX)**: Refactored `package.json` and `composer.json` to establish Composer
  as the primary project orchestrator.
- **Prettier Configuration**: Centralized formatting rules into `.prettierrc` for cleaner CLI
  interactions.

### Fixed

- **Logo Resolution**: Resolved an issue where the brand logo failed to appear in the Setup Wizard
  due to relative path resolution.
- **Component Discovery**: Fixed `MethodNotFoundException` by explicitly registering Livewire
  components for domain-isolated modules.
- **Browser Testing Compatibility**: Switched from Playwright back to Laravel Dusk to support older
  CPU architectures and maintain environment stability.
- **Setup Wizard UX**: Fixed a bug where the "Create Account" button provided no feedback during
  validation failures.
