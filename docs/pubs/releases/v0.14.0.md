# Release Note: v0.14.0 — Project Genesis: Foundational Overhaul

**Series Code:** ARC01-ORCH-01 | **Support Policy:** Experimental | **Readiness:** Development

---

## 🚀 Overview

Version `v0.14.0` constitutes a critical "Step Zero" milestone for the Internara project. 
It establishes the authoritative **Modular Monolith** infrastructure, enforcing strict 
domain isolation and systemic invariants defined in the **Project Genesis Blueprint**.

## 🏗️ Architectural Invariants (ISO/IEC 12207)

### 1. The "Architecture Police" (Pest Arch)
- **Modular Isolation**: Implemented precision isolation rules in `tests/Arch.php`. Domain 
  modules are now strictly forbidden from direct concrete coupling.
- **Service Layer Mandate**: Every domain service MUST now extend `BaseService` or 
  `EloquentQuery` from the `Shared` module.
- **Thin Component Rule**: Livewire components are now verified as "Thin Orchestrators," 
  delegating 100% of data orchestration to the Service Layer.

### 2. Identity & Persistence
- **UUID v4 Invariant**: Verified that all domain models utilize UUIDs via the `HasUuid` 
  concern for global identity integrity.
- **Identity Anchors**: Formalized `User` and `Profile` models as "Shared Identity Anchors" 
  accessible across modules for authorization and attribution.

## 🛠️ Engineering Improvements

- **Foundation Refactor**: 
    - Introduced `Modules\Shared\Services\BaseService` for non-persistence logic.
    - Refactored `AdminService`, `AuthService`, `NotificationService`, and others to 
      comply with the new service hierarchy.
- **Surgical Refactoring**:
    - **Admin Module**: Fully decoupled from `User` module's concrete classes and forms. 
      Introduced `AdminForm` for isolated state management.
    - **Assignment Module**: Refactored `AssignmentManager` and `AssignmentTypeManager` 
      to satisfy the Thin Component mandate.
- **Documentation Overhaul**: 
    - Consolidated the **Engineering Lifecycle** into `workflow.md`.
    - Flattened the **Testing Guide** and modernized the browser testing strategy (Laravel Dusk).
    - Renamed all `README.md` files to contextual names (e.g., `engineering-index.md`).

---

## ✅ Quality Gates

- **Verification**: 117 tests passed (100% GREEN).
- **Static Quality**: Zero violations in `composer lint` (Pint & Prettier).
- **Complexity**: All refactored services maintain a cyclomatic complexity < 10.

_This version marks the completion of the foundational engine. The system is now ready for 
high-fidelity feature development._
