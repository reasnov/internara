# Release Notes: v0.14.0 — Security Hardening & UI Evolution

**Series Code**: `ARC01-ORCH` | **Support Policy**: `Experimental` | **Readiness**: `Development`

---

## 1. Overview

This release marks a significant milestone in **System Stabilization and Quality Enforcement**, 
transitioning the baseline to **Development** readiness. It focuses on comprehensive **Security 
Hardening**, systemic **UI/UX Refinement** via DaisyUI, and critical **Performance 
Optimizations** to ensure Internara satisfies institutional-grade reliability and 
maintainability.

---

## 2. Key Improvements

### 🛡️ Security & Integrity Hardening (ISO/IEC 27034)

- **RBAC Sovereignty**: Standardized domain policies and hardened Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) 
  across all modules to ensure zero-trust boundary validation.
- **PII Protection**: Implemented distributed database encryption for sensitive profiles and 
  recursive PII masking in all logging sinks.
- **Vulnerability Patching**: Patched critical security vulnerabilities in `axios` and `psysh` 
  dependencies.
- **Signed Route Enforcement**: Secured high-privilege administrative actions with cryptographic 
  link integrity (Signed URLs).

### 🎨 UI/UX Evolution (TALL Stack)

- **DaisyUI Migration**: Completed the migration of the entire design system to native 
  **DaisyUI** and **Tailwind CSS v4**, reducing library overhead and improving visual 
  consistency.
- **Mobile-First Responsiveness**: Refactored the navigation, user menu, and sidebar for 
  optimal mobile-first operability, including icon-only minimalist views for small viewports.
- **Unified Record Management**: Standardized the `RecordManager` orchestration layer to ensure 
  consistent CRUD behavior and visual identity across all management entities.
- **Notification Overhaul**: Migrated the notification system to **PHPFlasher**, providing 
  glassmorphic, non-intrusive UI alerts with AOS-aware re-initialization.

### ⚡ Performance & Scalability (ISO/IEC 25010)

- **Memory Efficiency**: Implemented the `cursor()` pattern and selective column selection for 
  high-volume data exports and reports to minimize memory heap usage.
- **Intelligent Caching**: Introduced read-through caching for institutional static data and 
  eliminated service-layer N+1 queries in the `AnalyticsAggregator`.
- **Async Processing**: Offloaded heavy media conversions and cross-module side-effects to the 
  background queue.
- **Reactive Optimization**: Utilized Livewire's **Computed properties** and lazy loading for 
  complex, multi-module widgets and large dropdown collections.

### 🧪 Quality & Architectural Verification (V&V Audit)

- **Architecture Police**: Implemented a global **Architecture Verification Suite (Pest Arch)** to 
  automatically enforce modular isolation, strict typing, and the "Thin Component" rule.
- **Structural Audit**: Conducted a comprehensive architectural audit identifying "Architecture 
  Debt" in several domain modules regarding the delegation of logic from Livewire to the Service 
  Layer.
- **Portability Guard**: Enforced physical isolation invariants, ensuring zero physical foreign 
  keys across module boundaries are maintained at the software level.

## 3. What's Changed? (Changelog)

### Added

- **S3 Philosophy**: Formally codified the **Secure, Sustain, and Scalable (S3)** engineering 
  philosophy in the operational baseline.
- **Architecture Suite**: Introduced `tests/Arch.php` to automate the enforcement of 
  Project Genesis invariants and modular sovereignty.
- **Password Recovery**: Implemented a secure password recovery flow with environment-aware 
  complexity tiers.
- **Image Cropper**: Integrated a native image cropper for institutional branding and profile 
  management.

### Changed

- **UI Evolutionary Strategy**: Documented the long-term roadmap for UI library minimization 
  towards zero-dependency TALL components.
- **Documentation Synchronization**: Performed a comprehensive audit and synchronization of the 
  Architecture Description, SyRS, and Operational Guidelines to align with the current 
  technical state.
- **Milestone Correction**: Recalibrated the `v0.3.0` Release Note to accurately reflect 
  the "Institutional Foundation" series (ARC01-INST).
- **Identity Consolidation**: Formally documented the **Single Profile Strategy**, designating 
  the `Profile` model as the SSoT for all national and institutional user identifiers.
- **Governance Refinement**: Formally mandated Service-Layer authorization checks (`Gate::authorize`) 
  for all state-altering operations to ensure security outside HTTP contexts.
- **Record Management**: Unified all management tables to use direct `x-mary-table` components 
  for better performance and maintainability.
- **Environment Helpers**: Refactored global helpers into a "one-function-per-file" structure.

### Fixed

- **Modal Centering**: Re-implemented modals without native dialog to resolve centering and 
  clipping issues in nested containers.
- **Turnstile Stability**: Optimized Turnstile validation to be conditional and more resilient 
  during SPA navigation.
- **Language Switching**: Standardized redirection for language switching to improve 
  testability and UX.
