## 🚀 Overview

Administrative work shouldn't slow you down. Version **v0.7.0** is all about automation. We've built
an engine that automatically checks if students have met their internship requirements, plus new
tools to help staff manage large groups of students more efficiently.

## ✨ Key Features

### ⚙️ Requirement Checker

No more manual checklists. The system now handles the heavy lifting:

- **Document Verification**: Set mandatory documents (like permission letters) that students must
  upload before they can start.
- **Ready-to-Go Status**: The system automatically marks students as "Ready for Placement" once all
  their paperwork is verified.

### 📈 Smart Scoring

We've made grading more objective by looking at student engagement:

- **Participation Impact**: Student scores now automatically reflect their attendance and how
  regularly they submit their daily journals.
