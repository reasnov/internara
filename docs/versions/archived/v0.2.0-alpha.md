# Release Notes: v0.2.0-alpha (Core Phase)

This milestone focused on engineering the "brain" and "security infrastructure" of Internara. We
established universal tools and a robust authorization engine that serves as the foundation for all
future business domains.

## 🚀 Key Highlights

### 1. Robust RBAC Infrastructure

We integrated and customized `spatie/laravel-permission` within a modular context. This
implementation includes support for **UUIDs** and modular "ownership" of permissions, allowing for
granular access control across different actors.

### 2. Universal Shared Concerns

We introduced the `Shared` module, containing critical **Concerns** (Traits) such as:

- **`HasUuid`**: Standardizing identity across all domain models.
- **`HasStatuses`**: Providing a built-in audit trail for entity lifecycles.

### 3. Standardized Logic Layer

The `EloquentQuery` base service was established to reduce CRUD boilerplate and ensure a consistent
API across all domain services.
