# Release Notes: v0.3.0-alpha (User & Auth Phase)

This version establishes the human element of Internara. We introduced comprehensive user
management, specialized polymorphic-like profiles, and a secure authentication flow tailored for
educational institutions.

## 🚀 Key Highlights

### 1. Specialized Modular Profiles

We implemented dedicated profiles for **Students** (tracking NISN) and **Teachers** (tracking NIP).
These profiles utilize the `HasUserRelation` concern to link seamlessly with the core `User` model
while maintaining domain isolation.

### 2. Secure Identity Verification

Email verification is now mandatory for all academic roles. We customized the verification and
welcome notification templates to provide an institution-centric onboarding experience.

### 3. Role-Based Redirection

We implemented an intelligent redirection service that routes users to their respective workspaces
(e.g., `/student` vs. `/admin`) immediately after successful authentication.
