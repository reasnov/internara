## 🚀 Key Highlights

### 1. Academic Hierarchy

Organizing users into their real-world groups.

### 2. Internship Placements

Managing the supply and demand.

- **Capacity Tracking**: Manage industry partners and their available student slots.

Internara speaks your language.

- **EN/ID Switcher**: Full support for English and Indonesian, switchable instantly.
