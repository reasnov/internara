# Release Notes: v0.1.1-alpha (Genesis Phase)

This version represents the initialization of the Internara project. We focused on establishing a
resilient, modern foundation using the **Modular Monolith** pattern, ensuring that the system can
scale in complexity without sacrificing maintainability.

## 🚀 Key Highlights

### 1. Architectural Infrastructure

We successfully implemented the `nwidart/laravel-modules` engine, partitioning the application into
self-contained domains. This setup allows for low coupling and high cohesion from day one.

### 2. Modern TALL Stack Integration

The core backend is powered by **Laravel 12**, while the frontend leverages **Livewire 3** and
**Tailwind CSS 4**. This ensures a reactive user experience without the complexity of a traditional
JavaScript SPA.

### 3. Centralized UI Module

We established the `UI` module as the single source of truth for the project's design system,
utilizing **MaryUI** and **DaisyUI** to provide standardized accessible components.
