# What's New in Internara v0.1.1 (Genesis)

## 🌟 Overview

Welcome to the beginning of Internara! This version marks the official birth of our internship
management system. We've focused on building a solid, modern foundation that ensures the application
can grow and scale smoothly.

## ✨ Key Highlights

- **Modern Foundation:** We're using the latest web technologies (Laravel 12 and the TALL stack) to
  provide a fast and responsive experience.
- **Smart Structure:** The app is built as a "Modular Monolith," meaning different parts of the
  system (like Users or Programs) are organized into self-contained units for better reliability.
- **Clean Design:** We've introduced a centralized design system to ensure everything looks
  consistent and professional from day one.
