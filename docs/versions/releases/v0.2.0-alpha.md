# What's New in Internara v0.2.0 (Core & Shared)

## 🌟 Overview
In this update, we've focused on the "brain" and "security" of the system. We've established universal tools and a robust permission system that will power every feature in Internara.

## ✨ Key Highlights
- **Universal Toolbox:** We've created a set of shared tools that ensure data is handled consistently across the entire app.
- **Enhanced Security:** A new permission system is now in place, allowing us to precisely control what different users can see and do.
- **Secure IDs:** We've moved to a more secure way of identifying data (UUIDs), which helps protect your information.
