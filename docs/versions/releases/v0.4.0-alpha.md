# Release Notes: v0.4.0-alpha (Institutional Phase)

This version establishes the academic heart of Internara. We introduced school and department
management, established placement tracking, and finalized the system's localization framework.

## 🚀 Key Highlights

### 1. Decoupled Academic Structure

We implemented the `School` and `Department` modules. Following our **Isolation Principle**, we
successfully removed physical foreign key constraints between these modules, managing referential
integrity through the Service layer.

### 2. Global Language Switcher

We established a full localization framework supporting **English (en)** and **Indonesian (id)**.
This includes a real-time UI switcher and middleware that persists the user's preferred locale.

### 3. Internship Placement Tracking

We introduced the `Internship` module, enabling the management of industry partner programs and
available slots. This includes strict validation to prevent over-subscription of placements.
