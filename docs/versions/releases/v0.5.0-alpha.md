# What's New in Internara v0.5.0 (Operational)

## 🌟 Overview

This is our most interactive update yet! Internara now supports the day-to-day activities of an
internship, from logging daily tasks to tracking attendance.

## ✨ Key Highlights

- **Daily Journals:** Students can now record their daily tasks and reflections. Once approved by a
  supervisor, these logs are securely locked to ensure record integrity.
- **Attendance System:** A simple check-in and check-out system is now live, helping track presence
  and punctuality.
- **Academic Scoping:** All records are now neatly organized by Academic Year, making it easy to
  manage data year after year.
- **Unified Look:** We've updated all buttons and icons to a new, professional standard (Tabler
  Icons) for a more cohesive experience.
