# Release Notes: v0.5.0-alpha (Operational Phase)

This version introduces the core day-to-day functionality of Internara. We focused on student
activity tracking, supervisor relationships, and strict data scoping to ensure long-term academic
integrity.

---

## 🚀 Key Highlights

### 1. Daily Journal Logic (Logbooks)

We implemented the `Journal` module with a focus on record integrity.

- **Save as Draft**: Allows students to refine entries before submission.
- **Strict Locking**: Once a journal is verified or approved, updates are prohibited via Policy
  enforcement.
- **Media Support**: Integrated `MediaLibrary` for secure, temporary-URL-based attachments.

### 2. Punctual Attendance System

The `Attendance` module now provides real-time tracking of check-ins and check-outs. We integrated
this with global settings to automatically determine "Late" statuses based on configurable
thresholds.

### 3. Multi-Year Academic Scoping

Introduced the `HasAcademicYear` **Concern**. All operational data (Journals, Attendance,
Registrations) is now automatically scoped to the active academic session, ensuring data isolation
between cohorts.
