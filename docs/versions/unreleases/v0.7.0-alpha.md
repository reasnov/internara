# Version Note: v0.7.0-alpha (Administrative Automation)

**Status**: `In Progress` (Development Series: `ARC01-ORCH-01`)

This version focuses on transitioning Internara into a high-capacity administrative platform,
enabling coordinators to manage large student cohorts with minimal manual intervention.

## 🚀 Current Progress

### 1. Multidimensional Requirement Engine (Keystone 1)
We have successfully transitioned the requirement system from a static checklist to a dynamic
verification engine. By introducing `RequirementType` (Document, Skill, Condition), we can now
capture a diverse range of student data—from PDF permits to self-assessment ratings.
- **Verification Integrity**: Registrations are now locked until all mandatory items are verified,
  enforcing compliance at the service level.
- **Student UX**: A dedicated submission center allows students to track and fulfill requirements
  without administrative assistance.

### 2. Participation-Driven Assessment (Keystone 2)
In this version, we moved away from "opinion-only" grading. The system now cross-references
`Attendance` logs and `Journal` entries to calculate a `Compliance Score`.
- **Evidence-Based Metrics**: Mentors and Teachers now see real-time attendance and journal
  completion percentages directly on the evaluation form.
- **Service Decoupling**: We leveraged the `AttendanceService` and `JournalService` contracts to
  aggregate data across module boundaries without creating tight coupling.

### 3. Administrative Job Console (Keystone 3 & 4)
To support high-volume operations, we implemented a dedicated `JobMonitor`.
- **Visibility**: Admins can now monitor the `database` queue, retry failed exports, and clear
  stale jobs directly from the dashboard.
- **Global Notifications**: We bridged the `notify` event system to the `mary-toast` engine, ensuring
  that background job feedback reaches the user regardless of their current view.

### 4. Stakeholder Management & JIT Workflows (Keystone 5)
We optimized the administrative burden of onboarding mentors and teachers.
- **Just-in-Time (JIT) Onboarding**: Admins can now create and assign Industry Mentors directly from
  the Placement Manager, eliminating the need to navigate to separate user management modules.
- **Role Isolation**: Centralized `UserManager` ensures that Students, Teachers, and Mentors are
  managed within their appropriate context, while protecting Administrative accounts with
  SuperAdmin-only access.

## 🛠 Active Focus

- **Administrative Job Console**: UI for monitoring background batch processing (Certificates & Exports).
- **System Notification Integration**: Connecting `AppException` to `mary-toast` with anti-spam safeguards.
- **Intelligent Placement Engine**: Bulk matching for students, companies, and supervisors.
- **Advanced Reporting**: Aggregated school-wide performance metrics.
