# Overview: Version v0.1.x-alpha (Project Initiation)

## 1. Version Details

-   **Name**: `v0.1.x-alpha`
-   **Series Code**: `ARC01-INIT`
-   **Status**: `Completed`
-   **Description**: This version represents the **genesis** of the Internara project. The primary objective is not to deliver usable features, but to establish the technical "skeleton" of the application. It focuses exclusively on environment setup, architectural configuration, and defining the development standards that will govern all future work.

## 2. Goals & Architectural Philosophy (Pre-Production)

Before writing business logic, we must define the rules of engagement and the technological foundation. This phase addresses the critical need for scalability and structure to prevent "spaghetti code" in the future.

### Problem Keypoints

-   **Monolithic Decay:** Standard MVC structures tend to become tightly coupled over time.
-   **Inconsistent Tooling:** Without upfront standards, code quality varies between developers.

### Architectural Pillars

-   **Modular Monolith:** We reject the standard monolithic structure in favor of a strictly modular approach using `nwidart/laravel-modules`. Business logic must be encapsulated within modules.
-   **Service-Oriented:** Controllers must remain thin; logic resides in Services.
-   **Technology Stack:**
    -   **Backend:** Laravel v12 (PHP 8.2+).
    -   **Frontend:** TALL Stack (Tailwind CSS v4, Alpine.js, Laravel, Livewire v3).
    -   **Component Library:** DaisyUI + MaryUI.

### Architectural Constraints (The Rules)

To ensure the project starts correctly, the following rules are immutable for this version:

1.  **No "App" Logic:** The `app/` directory should remain minimal. All logic must reside in `modules/`.
2.  **No Business Features:** We do not create "Users", "Schools", or "Internships" yet. We only create the _capability_ to create them later.
3.  **Strict Namespaces:** All modules must follow the `Modules\{Name}\{Layer}` convention, omitting the `src` segment.

## 3. System Keystones & Scope (Production)

This section details the execution of the setup plan.

### System Keystones

#### Keystone 1: The Laravel Foundation

This is the base layer of the application, ensuring the framework is correctly installed and configured.

-   **Goal:** To establish a stable, standard Laravel v12 environment.
-   **Implementation:**
    -   **Approach:** Installed Laravel Framework v12.43.1. Configured the environment to use SQLite by default for portability during the initiation phase.
    -   **Analysis Reports:** Verified via `artisan --version`. Environment file `.env` is present and active.
    -   **Security and Testing:** Standard Laravel security measures (App Key, CSRF, etc.) are enabled. Storage symbolic links have been connected to ensure media availability.
-   **Developer Impact:** Provides a reliable and modern framework base for building all subsequent modules.

### Scope of Work (The Setup Plan)

The following tasks constitute the detailed execution plan.

#### 3.1. Environment & Framework Setup

-   [x] **Laravel Installation:** Initialize a clean Laravel v12 project.
-   [x] **Database Configuration:** Configure connection to the primary database (SQLite/MySQL).
-   [x] **Storage Link:** Establish symbolic links for storage.

#### 3.2. Modular Architecture Implementation

-   [x] **Package Installation:** Install `nwidart/laravel-modules`.
-   [x] **Configuration Override:**
    -   Modify `config/modules.php`.
    -   Change default namespace to `Modules`.
    -   Set custom path `modules/` (instead of `Modules/`).
    -   **Crucial:** Change the source folder from `app/` to `src/` to mimic package development.
-   [x] **Autoloading:** Update `composer.json` to adhere to the modular PSR-4 standard.

#### 3.3. Frontend Foundation (The UI Module)

-   [x] **UI Module Creation:** Generate the `UI` module (`php artisan module:make UI`). This will hold all global assets.
-   [x] **Stack Installation:**
    -   Install Tailwind CSS v4.
    -   Install DaisyUI and MaryUI.
    -   Install Livewire v3.
-   [x] **Asset Bundling:** Configure `vite.config.js` to process assets located specifically in `modules/UI/resources/`.

#### 3.4. Core Systems

-   [x] **Dependency Injection:** Create a `BindServiceProvider` to automatically scan and bind interfaces (`Contracts`) to their implementations (`Services`).
-   [x] **Permissions Setup:** Install `spatie/laravel-permission` and configure it for modular usage (preparing for the future `Permission` module).

---

## 4. Quality Assurance & Finalization (Post-Production)

After the implementation is complete, we must verify the integrity of the setup and establish quality gates before proceeding to feature development.

### 4.1. Quality Tooling Setup

-   [x] **Testing Framework:** Install and configure **Pest PHP**. Ensure it can discover tests located in `modules/*/tests/`.
-   [x] **Code Formatting:** Install **Laravel Pint** and configure `pint.json` with a strict preset to enforce coding standards.

### 4.2. Verification Checklist

-   [x] **Module Generation Test:** Run `php artisan module:make X` and verify it creates the correct folder structure (using `src/` instead of `app/`).
-   [x] **Asset Compilation Test:** Run `npm run build` and verify it correctly compiles assets from the `UI` module without errors.
-   [x] **Test Runner Check:** Run `php artisan test` to ensure the test suite is operational.
-   [x] **Lint Check:** Run `vendor/bin/pint --test` to verify the fresh codebase meets standards.

### 4.3. Security Issues

-   **Current Status:** No specific vulnerabilities identified in the initiation phase. Standard framework security is active.

### 4.4. Roadmap & Next Steps

Once this version is verified, development will proceed to `v0.2.x-alpha`, focusing on:

-   Implementation of the **Shared** module (Utilities).
-   Implementation of the **Permission** module (RBAC).
