# Overview: Version v0.1.x-alpha (Genesis)

- **Status**: `Released`
- **Description**: Initial project initiation, environment setup, and foundational architecture.

---

## 2. Goals & Architectural Philosophy (Pre-Production)

### Problem Keypoints

- **Monolithic Decay:** Standard MVC structures tend to become tightly coupled over time.
- **Inconsistent Tooling:** Lack of upfront standards leads to varying code quality.

### Architectural Pillars

- **Modular Monolith:** Encapsulation of business logic within self-contained modules.
- **Service-Oriented:** Logic resides in the Service layer, keeping Controllers thin.
- **Modern Stack:** Laravel 12, TALL Stack (Tailwind v4, Alpine, Laravel, Livewire v3).

### Architectural Constraints (The Rules)

1.  **Minimal App Directory:** All business and framework logic must reside within `modules/`.
2.  **No Early Domain Models:** Focus exclusively on infrastructure and capability development.
3.  **Strict Namespacing:** Adherence to the `Modules\{Name}\{Layer}` convention (omitting `src`).
