## 2. Goals & Architectural Philosophy (Pre-Production)

### Problem Analysis (The "Why")

Standard Laravel MVC applications often suffer from "Monolithic Decay," where business logic becomes
tangled across models and controllers, making long-term maintenance and scaling difficult. The goal
of this version was to prevent this decay from day one by implementing a strict modular structure.

### Architectural Pillars (The "How")

The primary strategy was the adoption of a **Modular Monolith** pattern using
`nwidart/laravel-modules`. This allows Internara to be built as a collection of self-contained
mini-applications. To ensure consistent interaction between these modules, we established a
**Service-Oriented** approach where all business orchestration resides in dedicated Service layers,
leaving controllers and Livewire components as thin entry points.

### Architectural Constraints (The Rules)

To maintain modular integrity, a non-negotiable rule was established: the `app/` directory must
remain empty of business logic, serving only as a bootstrap layer for global ServiceProviders. All
feature-specific code must reside within the `modules/` root.

## 3. Production Keystones (Analytical Narrative)

### Keystone 1: Modular Monolith Foundation

#### Technical Rationale

Choosing `nwidart/laravel-modules` provided the necessary structure to encapsulate domains. We
customized the generator to follow our strict namespace convention (`Modules\{Name}\{Layer}`),
stripping the `src` segment to keep imports clean and professional.

#### Implementation Deep-Dive

The core of this keystone was the implementation of the `BindServiceProvider`. This foundational
service implements an **Auto-Discovery** mechanism that automatically binds interfaces to their
concrete implementations based on naming conventions. This eliminates manual registration overhead
and enforces an **Interface-First** mindset across all modules.

#### Architectural Impact

This setup transformed the application from a standard framework instance into a scalable
engineering platform. It ensured that every future module would be portable and independently
testable.

### Keystone 2: UI Module & TALL Stack Integration

#### Technical Rationale

Instead of spreading CSS and JS across modules, we centralized all frontend assets into a dedicated
`UI` module. This ensures a **Single Source of Truth** for the application's visual language.

#### Implementation Deep-Dive

We integrated **Tailwind CSS v4** and **DaisyUI** for styling, with **Livewire v3** and **MaryUI**
providing the interactive layer. The `UI` module serves as the asset entry point, bundling all
module-specific resources through a unified Vite configuration.

#### Architectural Impact

Centralizing the UI prevents "design drift" and simplifies global theme updates. It allows feature
modules to focus strictly on their business views without worrying about infrastructure styling.

## 4. Quality Assurance & Artifact Sync (Post-Production)

### 4.1. Verification Analysis

The initial test suite focused on validating the modular scaffolding and the auto-discovery system.
Using **Pest PHP**, we confirmed that modules could correctly resolve dependencies through the
`BindServiceProvider`. Manual verification ensured that the asset pipeline successfully bundled
Tailwind v4 features into the final build.

### 4.2. Continuous Documentation Sync

During this phase, the **Architecture Guide** and **Installation Guide** were drafted to provide a
clear entry point for new developers. The `docs/` structure was initialized to follow the
Doc-as-Code principle.

### 4.3. Security & Privacy Audit

The audit confirmed that no business logic or secrets were exposed in the `app/` directory. Initial
middleware was established to ensure that the environment remains secure during the setup phase.

### 4.4. Roadmap Strategy (vNext)

With the foundation set, the next iteration will focus on building the **Shared** utilities and the
**Permission** (RBAC) system to enable secure domain development.
