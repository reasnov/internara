## 🚀 Overview

administrative governance. We are introducing tools for mass onboarding, strict temporal 
integrity, and automated audit logging to ensure operational readiness for large-scale internship 
cycles.

## ✨ Key Features

### 🎓 Learning & Skills Tracking

We are making it easier to see how student activities help them reach their goals:

- **Skill Maps**: Teachers can now define specific skills and learning goals for each department.
- **Progress Chart**: A new visual "Radar" helps students and teachers see growth.

### 🤝 Mentoring & Supervision

Improving communication between students and their industry mentors:

- **Visit Reports**: Supervisors can quickly log their on-site visits and provide feedback.
- **Flexible Feedback**: A better way to record all types of conversations and guidance sessions.

### 🗓️ Timeline & Governance Orchestration

Advanced administrative control over internship periods and data integrity:

- **Batch Onboarding**: Mass import students, teachers, and mentors via CSV with automated 
  credential generation.
- **Temporal Guard**: Strict start/end date invariants for registrations, automatically gating 
  attendance and journal activities.
- **Dual-Tier Logging**: We separate system logs (for data security) and user activity logs (such as login history and profile changes) to make the system more transparent and secure. All logging is now centralized in the new **Log** module.
- **Activity Feed**: Administrators can now monitor recent user actions and system events through a dedicated activity feed in the dashboard.
- **Standardized Media Handling**: We've improved how the system handles files and images, ensuring a more consistent and reliable experience when uploading avatars, reports, or journal attachments.
- **Dynamic Assignment Framework**: Initialized the new **Assignment** module, which will allow schools to flexibly define mandatory tasks for students beyond the standard reports.
