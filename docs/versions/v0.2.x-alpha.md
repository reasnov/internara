# Overview: Version v0.2.x-alpha (ARC01-CORE)

## 1. Version Details

- **Name**: `v0.2.x-alpha`
- **Series Code**: `ARC01-CORE`
- **Status**: `Completed`
- **Description**: This version focuses on building essential "Shared" utilities and the
  "Permission" (RBAC) system.

---

## 2. Goals & Architectural Philosophy (Pre-Production)

### Problem Keypoints

- **Duplicate Utility Logic:** Lack of a shared module leads to reinventing helper functions.
- **Fragile Security:** Manual RBAC implementation across modules is error-prone.
- **Inconsistent Data Handling:** Lack of standardized model traits (UUID, Status tracking).

### Architectural Pillars

- **Shared-First Philosophy:** Universal logic must reside in the `Shared` module.
- **RBAC Sovereignty:** Centralized permission management with local enforcement.
- **Service Abstraction:** Enhancing `EloquentQuery` for standardized data orchestration.

### Architectural Constraints (The Rules)

1.  **Strict Isolation:** Domain modules must use standard Laravel Gates/Policies to interact with
    permissions.
2.  **No Direct Model Reference:** Inter-module communication must happen via Interfaces or Events.
3.  **Mandatory Trait Usage:** All domain models requiring UUIDs or Status tracking must use the
    Shared traits.

## 3. System Keystones (Production)

### Keystone 1: Custom Modular Generators

- **Goal**: To automate consistent scaffolding while respecting strict namespace conventions.
- **Implementation**: Developed `module:make-class`, `module:make-interface`, and
  `module:make-trait` commands in the `Core` module.
- **Developer Impact**: Eliminates manual directory management and namespace correction.

### Keystone 2: Shared Foundational Traits & Services

- **Goal**: To standardize core Eloquent behaviors across the entire application.
- **Implementation**: Created `HasUuid` and `HasStatus` traits. Finalized the `EloquentQuery` base
  service for standardized CRUD.
- **Developer Impact**: Ensures all domain models are consistently auditable and secure by default.

### Keystone 3: RBAC & Permission Infrastructure

- **Goal**: To implement a robust, modularized security layer.
- **Implementation**: Encapsulated `spatie/laravel-permission` within a dedicated `Permission`
  module with full UUID support.
- **Developer Impact**: Provides a centralized "Source of Truth" for authorization that is easy to
  consume via Gates/Policies.

## 4. Quality Assurance & Finalization (Post-Production)

### 4.1. Quality Tooling Setup

- [x] **Pest Suites:** Unit and Feature tests implemented for all Shared traits and Services.
- [x] **Pint Formatting:** All core modules formatted according to project standards.

### 4.2. Verification Checks

- [x] **Shared Utility Test:** All unit tests for UUID and Status passed.
- [x] **RBAC Enforcement Test:** Verified correct restriction via Gates and Policies.
- [x] **Zero-App Logic:** Confirmed `app/` remains empty of business logic.

### 4.3. Documentation Checks

- [x] RBAC and Permission Management Guide documented.
- [x] Shared Traits and EloquentQuery Service technical reference completed.

### 4.4. Security Issues

- No critical issues identified during audit.

### 4.5. Roadmap & Next Steps (v0.3.x-alpha)

#### Must Have

- Implementation of the **User** administrative management (CRUD).

- Development of the **Profile** module with polymorphic role data (NIP/NISN).

- Implementation of **Role-Based Redirection** after login.

- Mandatory **Email Verification** for Student and Teacher roles.

#### Should Have

- Refinement of modular generators for faster scaffolding.

- Integration of **Avatar management** system for all user profiles.

- Standardized **Welcome notifications** for newly created accounts.

#### Won't Have

- Academic structure management (School/Department).

- Internship operational workflows (Journals, Attendance).

- Automated assessment or reporting engines.
