## 1. Version Details

- **Series Code**: `ARC01-CORE-01`
- **Scope**: `Core & Shared`
- **Status**: `Stable`
- **Current Operational Context**: Establishing universal utilities and the RBAC security
  infrastructure.

## 2. Goals & Architectural Philosophy (Pre-Production)

### Problem Analysis (The "Why")

Without a shared foundation, modular development often leads to the duplication of utility logic
(like UUID generation or status management) across different domains. Furthermore, implementing
granular security manually in each module is error-prone and leads to inconsistent authorization
gates that are difficult to audit.

### Architectural Pillars (The "How")

We introduced a **Shared-First Philosophy**, where any logic that is business-agnostic must be
placed in the `Shared` module to ensure maximum reuse. For security, we adopted **RBAC
Sovereignty**, centralizing permission management while allowing domain modules to enforce their own
local policies independently through standard framework interfaces.

### Architectural Constraints (The Rules)

All domain models requiring unique identification MUST use the `HasUuid` trait. Inter-module
authorization checks MUST use standard Laravel Gates or Policies to ensure domain modules remain
decoupled from the specific implementation of the `Permission` module.

## 3. Production Keystones (Analytical Narrative)

### Keystone 1: Shared Foundational Traits & Services

#### Technical Rationale

To ensure data integrity and system-wide consistency, we standardized core Eloquent behaviors using
traits. This prevents "reinventing the wheel" and ensures all modules follow the same technical
standards for identification and state tracking.

#### Implementation Deep-Dive

The center of this keystone was the `EloquentQuery` base service. This service abstracts complex
querying, searching, and sorting logic, providing a high-level API for all subsequent domain
services. We also finalized the `HasUuid` trait for automatic primary key generation and `HasStatus`
for standardized lifecycle management.

#### Architectural Impact

This keystone established the technical foundation of Internara. Every future domain service now
inherits standardized CRUD capabilities, significantly reducing boilerplate and increasing the
reliability of data operations.

### Keystone 2: RBAC & Permission Infrastructure

#### Technical Rationale

Security must be a cross-cutting concern that doesn't bloat domain logic. We encapsulated
`spatie/laravel-permission` within a dedicated module to provide a portable and auditable security
layer.

#### Implementation Deep-Dive

The `Permission` module was built with full UUID support. We established **Policy Patterns** that
allow domain modules to define their own abilities (e.g., `internship.create`) while the
`Permission` module handles the underlying role-to-permission mapping.

#### Architectural Impact

This provided a centralized "Source of Truth" for authorization. It allows for granular control over
user actions without requiring domain modules to depend on specific user management logic.

## 4. Quality Assurance & Artifact Sync (Post-Production)

### 4.1. Verification Analysis

Verification focused on the stability of the `EloquentQuery` service and the accuracy of UUID
generation. Unit tests using **Pest** achieved high coverage for the Shared traits. Feature tests
verified that permission gates correctly blocked unauthorized access across module boundaries.

### 4.2. Continuous Documentation Sync

Technical references for **Shared Traits** and the **EloquentQuery Service** were completed. The
**Role & Permission Management Guide** was published as the primary security reference for the
project.

### 4.3. Security & Privacy Audit

The audit confirmed that all cross-module authorization checks are performed via Interfaces. No
direct model references between domain modules and the `Permission` module were found, upholding our
isolation principles.

### 4.4. Roadmap Strategy (vNext)

The next iteration (`v0.3.x`) will focus on the **User & Profile** system, leveraging this new RBAC
infrastructure to build specialized administrative and self-service interfaces.
