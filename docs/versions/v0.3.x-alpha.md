## 2. Goals & Architectural Philosophy

The objective of `v0.3.x-alpha` is to transition from system infrastructure to user-facing core features. We aim to provide a robust User Management system for administrators and a self-service Profile system for students, teachers, and staff.

### Problem Keypoints

-   **Fragmented User Data:** Ensuring all user types (Admin, Student, Teacher) share a consistent base model while having specialized profiles.
-   **Manual Account Provisioning:** The need for automated and secure user creation workflows.
-   **Auth Experience:** Refining the authentication and verification flows for a production-ready feel.

### Architectural Pillars

-   **Identity & Access Integration:** Leveraging the `Permission` module for all user-related authorization.
-   **Profile Polymorphism:** Handling specialized profile data through modular relations.
-   **Self-Service UI:** Providing intuitive Livewire components for profile editing and security settings.

## 3. System Keystones & Scope

### Scope of Work (The Development Plan)

The following tasks constitute the detailed execution plan for this version.

#### 3.1. The User Module (Management)

-   [ ] **User CRUD:** Implement a full administrative interface for managing users (List, Create, Edit, Delete).
-   [ ] **Account Activation:** Implement workflows for account verification and password resets.
-   [ ] **Specialized Roles:** Refining how users are assigned to roles during registration or management.

#### 3.2. The Profile Module (Self-Service)

-   [ ] **Unified Profile UI:** Create a centralized dashboard for users to manage their basic information and avatar.
-   [ ] **Security Settings:** Allow users to update their passwords and manage session-related settings.
-   [ ] **Type-Specific Fields:** Integrate specialized fields for Students (e.g., NISN) and Teachers (e.g., NIP) within the profile flow.

#### 3.3. Auth System Refinement

-   [ ] **Standardized Login/Logout:** Refine the `Auth` module components to use the new `AppException` and UI patterns.
-   [ ] **Verification Logic:** Ensure email verification is strictly enforced where required.

## 4. Quality Assurance & Roadmap

### 4.1. Verification Checklist

-   [ ] **User Management Test:** Verify that administrators can manage users while respecting RBAC.
-   [ ] **Self-Profile Test:** Verify that users can only edit their own profile data.
-   [ ] **Security Audit:** Ensure no PII is exposed through insecure API endpoints or Livewire state.

### 4.2. Roadmap & Next Steps

Once `v0.3.x-alpha` is stable, development will proceed to `v0.4.x-alpha`, focusing on:

-   Implementation of the **School** and **Department** management.
-   Foundational **Internship** registration workflows.
