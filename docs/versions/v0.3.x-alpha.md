# Overview: Version v0.3.x-alpha (User & Profile Management)

## 1. Version Details

-   **Name**: `v0.3.x-alpha`
-   **Series Code**: `ARC01-USER`

## 2. Goals & Architectural Philosophy

The objective of `v0.3.x-alpha` is to transition from system infrastructure to user-facing core features. We aim to provide a robust User Management system for administrators and a self-service Profile system for students, teachers, and staff.

### Problem Keypoints

-   **Fragmented User Data:** Ensuring all user types (Admin, Student, Teacher) share a consistent base model while having specialized profiles.
-   **Manual Account Provisioning:** The need for automated and secure user creation workflows.
-   **Auth Experience:** Refining the authentication and verification flows for a production-ready feel.

### Architectural Pillars

-   **Identity & Access Integration:** Leveraging the `Permission` module for all user-related authorization.
-   **Profile Polymorphism:** Handling specialized profile data through modular relations.
-   **Self-Service UI:** Providing intuitive Livewire components for profile editing and security settings.

## 3. System Keystones & Scope

### Scope of Work (The Development Plan)

The following tasks constitute the detailed execution plan for this version.

#### 3.1. Foundation & Core Tooling

-   [x] **App Info Command:** Create `php artisan app:info` to display application name, version (including series code), author, and environment details.
-   [x] **Module Inventory & Documentation:** Scan the `modules/` directory to identify all existing modules and their purposes. Create comprehensive documentation in `docs/main/modules/`.
-   [x] **UI Module Asset Audit:** 
    -   Scan the `UI` module to identify all established Blade and Livewire components.
    -   Create comprehensive reference documentation in `docs/main/ui/`.

#### 3.2. The User Module (Administrative)

-   [ ] **User CRUD & Management:** Implement a full administrative interface for **Admins** and **SuperAdmins** to manage all accounts.
-   [ ] **Role-Based Account Provisioning:** Refine the creation flow to allow assigning roles (`Admin`, `Teacher`, `Student`) with appropriate default settings (including status and auto-verification).
-   [ ] **Account Security:** Implement administrative password resets and account activation/deactivation toggles.

#### 3.3. The Profile Module (Role-Specific Self-Service)

-   [ ] **Unified Profile UI:** A shared dashboard for all users to manage basic info (Name, Email, Username) and Avatar.
-   [ ] **Student Specialized Profile:** Implement fields specific to **Students** (e.g., NISN, Class, Major).
-   [ ] **Teacher Specialized Profile:** Implement fields specific to **Teachers** (e.g., NIP, Specialization).
-   [ ] **Security Self-Service:** Allow all users to update their own passwords and manage active sessions.

#### 3.4. Auth System & Experience

-   [ ] **Role-Based Redirection:** Implement intelligent redirection after login (e.g., Students to their journal, Admins to the dashboard).
-   [ ] **Standardized Components:** Refine Login, Registration, and Password Reset views using the `UI` module and `AppException` patterns.
-   [ ] **Email Verification:** Ensure mandatory verification for **Students** and **Teachers** to secure the platform.

## 4. Quality Assurance & Roadmap

### 4.1. Verification Checklist

-   [ ] **User Management Test:** Verify that administrators can manage users while respecting RBAC.
-   [ ] **Self-Profile Test:** Verify that users can only edit their own profile data.
-   [ ] **Security Audit:** Ensure no PII is exposed through insecure API endpoints or Livewire state.

### 4.2. Roadmap & Next Steps

Once `v0.3.x-alpha` is stable, development will proceed to `v0.4.x-alpha`, focusing on:

-   Implementation of the **School** and **Department** management.
-   Foundational **Internship** registration workflows.
