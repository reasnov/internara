# Overview: Version v0.4.x-alpha (Institutional)

## 1. Version Details

- **Name**: `v0.4.0-alpha`
- **Series Code**: `ARC01-INST-01`
- **Status**: `Released`
- **Current Operational Context**: Establishing the academic and institutional foundation through
  decoupled management systems.

## 2. Goals & Architectural Philosophy (Pre-Production)

### Problem Analysis (The "Why")

Before this version, the system lacked the institutional context necessary for an internship
platform. We needed a way to manage Schools and Departments, link them to student registrations, and
track placement quotas. Technically, we also needed to address the growing risk of cross-module
database coupling.

### Architectural Pillars (The "How")

We established **Institutional Hierarchy** by defining clear relationships between Schools and
Departments. For technical integrity, we adopted the **Database Isolation Principle**, moving from
physical foreign keys to application-level integrity to ensure modules remain truly portable.

### Architectural Constraints (The Rules)

Cross-module foreign key constraints are strictly forbidden. Tables must use UUID columns with
manual indexes. All institutional forms MUST support multi-language (EN/ID) translation keys from
day one to support our demographic targets.

## 3. Production Keystones (Analytical Narrative)

### Keystone 1: Decoupled Database Schema Refactor

#### Technical Rationale

To achieve true modular portability, modules should not depend on each other's migration order or
physical database constraints.

#### Implementation Deep-Dive

We conducted a comprehensive refactor of our migrations, removing all `constrained()` calls that
crossed module boundaries. Integrity is now guarded by the Service layer; for example, the
`InternshipRegistrationService` verifies the existence of a student's ID through the `UserService`
interface before saving a record.

#### Architectural Impact

This refactor allows modules to be extracted or deployed independently. It eliminates "migration
lock" and ensures that our modular monolith remains flexible enough to evolve into microservices if
needed.

### Keystone 2: Institutional & Registration Foundation

#### Technical Rationale

Establishing the School and Department modules provides the necessary "containers" for students and
placement tracking.

#### Implementation Deep-Dive

We implemented full administrative CRUD for `School` and `Department` models. A key achievement was
the integration of **Capacity Tracking** in the `InternshipPlacement` service, which prevents
over-allocation of student slots at industry partners. We also developed a global `LanguageSwitcher`
to ensure accessibility across English and Indonesian locales.

#### Architectural Impact

This moves Internara from a pure identity system to a specialized business tool. It provides the
structural context required for the operational tracking phase.

## 4. Quality Assurance & Artifact Sync (Post-Production)

### 4.1. Verification Analysis

Verification focused on the integrity of registration flows using UUIDs. Pest tests confirmed that
profile-department integration correctly handles academic context. Automated linting via Pint and
Prettier was enforced to ensure code quality across the refactored modules.

### 4.2. Continuous Documentation Sync

New technical guides for the **School** and **Department** modules were published. The **Release
Guidelines** and **Software Lifecycle** documents were overhauled to reflect our maturing processes.

### 4.3. Security & Privacy Audit

We migrated all institutional primary keys to UUIDs to significantly reduce IDOR risks. Granular
Policies were implemented for every new domain model, ensuring that only authorized administrators
can manage academic structures.

### 4.4. Roadmap Strategy (vNext)

The focus now moves to **Operational Tracking** (`v0.5.x`), where we will implement Daily Journals,
Attendance systems, and formal Supervisor Matching.
