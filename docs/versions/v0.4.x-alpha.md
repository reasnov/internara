## 2. Goals & Architectural Philosophy (Pre-Production)

### Problem Keypoints

- **Lack of Institutional Context:** The system currently lacks the concept of a School/Department to which students and teachers belong.
- **Manual Slot Management:** Internship placements are not yet tracked or limited by quota.
- **Single-Language UI:** Need for a robust UI mechanism to switch between English and Indonesian.

### Architectural Pillars

- **Institutional Hierarchy:** Defining a clear relationship between the School and its Departments.
- **Capacity Tracking:** Implementing slot-based registration to prevent over-allocation.
- **Profile Integration:** Linking User profiles to their respective academic structures (Student -> Department).

### Architectural Constraints (The Rules)

1.  **Strict Modular Boundaries:** The `School` and `Department` modules must remain portable and communicative only via established patterns.
2.  **Resource Ownership:** Institutional data must be manageable only by authorized administrative accounts.
3.  **Localization-First UI:** All new institutional forms and displays must use translation keys from day one.
