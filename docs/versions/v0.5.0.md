## 🌟 Overview

This version brings Internara to life day-to-day. We introduced the tools needed for the actual
internship period: **Daily Journals** and **Real-time Attendance**.

---

## 🚀 Key Highlights

### 1. Daily Journals

Capturing the student's journey.

- **Write & Verify**: Students write daily logs, and mentors verify them.
- **Locked History**: Once approved, journals cannot be changed, ensuring an honest record of
  activity.
- **Attachments**: Support for uploading photos or documents as evidence.

### 2. Smart Attendance

Tracking discipline in real-time.

- **Check-In/Out**: Simple buttons for students to mark their presence.
- **Auto-Late Detection**: The system automatically marks students as "Late" based on school rules.

### 3. Academic Year Scoping

Keeping data organized.

- **Cohort Isolation**: Data is automatically grouped by Academic Year. Next year's students won't
  see this year's journals.

---

## 🛠 Stability & Quality

- **Data Integrity**: Verified that students can't fake their attendance timestamps.
- **Privacy**: Mentors only see journals from students assigned to them.

## 🔮 What's Next (v0.6.0)

With daily tracking active, the next step is **Assessment**. We will build the grading engine to
turn these journals and attendance records into a final score.
