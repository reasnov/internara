# Overview: Version v0.5.x-alpha (Operational)

## 1. Version Details

- **Name**: `v0.5.0-alpha`

- **Status**: `Released` (2026-01-18)
- **Current Operational Context**: Implementing high-frequency tracking systems for student
  activity, attendance, and supervision.

## 2. Goals & Architectural Philosophy (Pre-Production)

### Problem Analysis (The "Why")

While previous versions established "who" the users are and "where" they belong, the system lacked
the capability to track "what" they do. There was no mechanism for recording daily progress,
monitoring attendance, or formalizing the mentorship bond between industry partners and academic
staff.

### Architectural Pillars (The "How")

We introduced **Operational Data Streams** to manage journals and logs efficiently. For the
frontend, we adopted **UI Abstraction** as a primary strategy—centralizing all component definitions
into the `UI` module to enforce visual consistency and decouple business views from specific CSS
frameworks.

### Architectural Constraints (The Rules)

Direct use of Tailwind or DaisyUI classes for core elements in feature modules is forbidden;
standardized `x-ui::` components MUST be used. Journal entries MUST be immutable once approved to
ensure historical integrity. All operational data MUST be scoped to the active Academic Year.

## 3. Production Keystones (Analytical Narrative)

### Keystone 1: UI Component Refactor & Icon Standardization

#### Technical Rationale

Frontend maintenance becomes a bottleneck when CSS classes are scattered across modules. We needed a
way to update global styles and icons from a single source.

#### Implementation Deep-Dive

We systematically replaced raw HTML and MaryUI direct calls with standardized wrappers in the `UI`
module. A major sub-task was **Icon Standardization**, where we unified the entire application to
use **Tabler Icons** with the `tabler.name` dot-notation format. We also consolidated the file
upload system into a single, interactive `x-ui::file` component that wraps the `x-mary-file` engine
while supporting custom slots for previews.

#### Architectural Impact

This refactor enforces a cohesive visual language and drastically reduces the cost of design
changes. It ensures that every module, from Attendance to User management, feels like part of the
same product.

### Keystone 2: Operational Context & Configuration

#### Technical Rationale

Operational data loses its value without context. We needed to ensure that journals and attendance
logs were tied to specific academic periods and manageable via administrative settings.

#### Implementation Deep-Dive

We implemented a global **Academic Year** setting in the `Setting` module. All operational services
were updated to automatically inject this scoping during data creation. We also moved hardcoded
attendance thresholds (like late times) to the database, allowing for school-wide adjustments
without code changes. Finally, we implemented **Strict Journal Locking** in the `JournalService`,
preventing any modification to entries once they are approved.

#### Architectural Impact

This prepares the database for multi-year historical data and provides the flexibility required for
real-world institutional variations. It moves the system from a prototype to a production-ready
operational tool.

## 4. Quality Assurance & Artifact Sync (Post-Production)

### 4.1. Verification Analysis

The verification cycle focused on the newly introduced locking logic and dynamic settings. We
achieved a 100% pass rate across 49 tests using **Pest**. Special attention was given to the
`tabler.name` icon rendering, ensuring that the MaryUI integration remained error-free after our
standardization refactor.

### 4.2. Continuous Documentation Sync

All modular technical guides were moved to their respective `modules/{Name}/README.md` to improve
developer accessibility. The **UI/UX Development Guide** was updated to reflect the new Tabler Icon
standards and the consolidated File component.

### 4.3. Security & Privacy Audit

The audit verified the **Supervisor IDOR protection**, confirming that mentors and teachers can only
approve journals for their assigned students. We also validated that signed URL generation for
private student attachments is functioning correctly.

### 4.4. Roadmap Strategy (vNext)

The next major iteration (`v0.6.x`) will focus on the **Assessment Engine**, introducing
multi-perspective scoring (Industry vs. School) and automated PDF certificate generation.
