# Overview: Version v0.6.0-alpha (Assessment & Finalization)

This version represents a critical milestone in the Internara project, completing the core
internship lifecycle. We transitioned from tracking activity to formalizing outcomes through
automated reporting and role-specific workspaces.

## 1. Goals & Strategic Philosophy

### 1.1 The "Paperwork Bottleneck"

Moving from daily journal entries to final evaluation often creates an administrative bottleneck.
Mentors need a frictionless way to provide feedback, and Teachers require a unified view of student
performance. `v0.6.0` bridges this gap by centralizing the assessment engine and automating document
generation.

### 1.2 Strategic Pillars

- **Workspace Decomposition**: Moving away from a monolithic dashboard to role-specific mini-apps.
- **Unified Logic**: Grading algorithms are centralized in a dedicated module serving all actors.
- **Verifiable Artifacts**: Completion certificates are now verifiable offline via QR-code
  signatures.

## 2. Production Keystones (Deep-Dive)

### Keystone 1: RBAC Workspace Segmentation

The original `Dashboard` module was a catch-all. We decomposed it into `Admin`, `Student`,
`Teacher`, and `Mentor` modules.

- **Benefit**: Reduced cognitive load and cleaner permission gating.
- **Tech**: All workspaces share the `ui::layouts.dashboard` for visual consistency.

### Keystone 2: Dual-Perspective Assessment Engine

Internship success is now captured from both industrial (Mentor) and academic (Teacher)
perspectives.

- **Implementation**: The `AssessmentService` calculates weighted averages and handles feedback
  persistence.
- **Security**: Strict ownership checks ensure only assigned supervisors can grade their students.

### Keystone 3: Automated PDF & QR-Code Verification

We eliminated manual drafting by integrating `laravel-dompdf` and `simple-qrcode`.

- **Signed URLs**: Verification links are tamper-proof and do not require an account to view.
- **UI**: Added contextual download triggers to the Student and Admin dashboards.

## 3. Verification & Quality Analysis

### 3.1 Test Analysis

- **Pass Rate**: 100% (65 tests).
- **Environment Stability**: Resolved Signal 4 crashes related to `decimal:2` casts by standardizing
  on `float`.

### 3.2 Security Audit

- **Broken Access Control**: Remediated a vulnerability where supervisors could theoretically assess
  students not assigned to their department.
- **Signed Artifacts**: Verified expiration and invalidation logic for QR-code links.

## 4. Roadmap Alignment (vNext)

The next series (**v0.7.x**) will focus on **Administrative Automation**, specifically bulk
operations for certificate generation and batch internship status transitions.
