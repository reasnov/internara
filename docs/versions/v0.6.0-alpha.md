## 🌟 Overview

The circle is complete! This version brings **Role Specialization** to Internara. Everyone—Students,
Teachers, Mentors, and Admins—now has their own dedicated workspace. Plus, we've launched the
official Assessment and Certificate engine.

## 🚀 Key Highlights

### 1. Dedicated Workspaces

A cleaner, safer experience for everyone.

- **Role-Specific Views**: Students only see what they need to succeed; Mentors only see what they
  need to evaluate.
- **Privacy First**: Strict separation ensures no data leaks between different user roles.

### 2. Official Assessment Engine

Grading made professional.

- **Unified Scoring**: Industry Mentors and School Teachers submit evaluations via a standardized
  form.
- **Automated Calculation**: The system combines these scores to produce the final grade instantly.

### 3. Verifiable Certificates

Proof of completion that can be trusted.

- **Instant Download**: Students can download their official **Certificate of Completion** directly.
- **Anti-Fraud**: Every certificate includes a secure **QR Code**. Scanning it instantly verifies
  authenticity on our public verification page.

## 🛠 Stability & Fixes

- **Security Audit**: Verified that students cannot access certificates belonging to others.
- **Access Control**: Hardened permissions so supervisors can only grade their own assigned
  students.

## 🔮 What's Next (v0.7.0)

With the core flow finished, we are moving to **Automation**. The upcoming version will focus on
auto-verifying prerequisites to help admins manage larger student cohorts.
