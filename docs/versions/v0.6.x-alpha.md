# Overview: Version v0.6.x-alpha (Assessment & Finalization)

## 1. Version Details

- **Name**: `v0.6.x-alpha`
- **Series Code**: `ARC01-FEAT-01`
- **Status**: `In Progress`
- **Current Operational Context**: Implementing a simplified, manual assessment flow that connects industry feedback with academic evaluation.

## 2. Goals & Architectural Philosophy (Pre-Production)

### Problem Analysis (The "Why")

Moving from daily tracking to final evaluation often creates a "paperwork bottleneck." Mentors in industry are busy and need a very simple way to provide feedback, while Teachers need a unified view of student performance (Attendance, Journal, and Industry Score) to provide a final academic grade. We need to replace complex automated engines with a streamlined manual workflow that minimizes friction for all users.

### Architectural Pillars (The "How")

We will implement a **Unified Assessment Module** that prioritizes ease of input. Instead of complex rules, we provide clear, predefined criteria that Mentors can grade with a few clicks. The system will then aggregate these manual inputs into a **Final Finalization Report**, reducing the administrative burden on Teachers.

### Architectural Constraints (The Rules)

Assessment forms MUST be intuitive and mobile-friendly for busy mentors. Every grade entry MUST be auditable (tracking who entered what and when). Finalization can only occur once both Industry and School portions are completed.

## 3. Production Keystones (Analytical Narrative)

### Keystone 1: Role-Based Workspace Segmentation (RBAC Workspaces)

#### Technical Rationale
The central `Dashboard` module has become "noisy" and monolithic, mixing concerns from too many actors. To improve User Experience (UX) and cognitive focus, we will decompose the dashboard into dedicated, role-specific workspaces.

#### Implementation Deep-Dive
**(Completed)**
- **Deprecation:** The `Dashboard` module was successfully removed.
- **New Modules:** Introduced `Admin`, `Student`, `Teacher`, and `Mentor` modules as dedicated workspaces.
- **Responsibility:** These modules serve strictly as **Presentation & Orchestration Layers**.
- **Data Boundary:** Validated that `User` module remains the single source of truth for identity.
- **Verification:** Feature tests confirming strict RBAC routing and isolation have passed. Fixed icon rendering issues (`SvgNotFound`) by standardizing on `tabler.name`.

#### Architectural Impact
Enforces a strict separation between "Who you are" (User Module) and "Where you work" (Workspace Modules), significantly cleaning up the UI layer.

### Keystone 2: Streamlined Dual-Perspective Assessment

#### Technical Rationale
To ensure a balanced evaluation without over-engineering, we will provide separate, simple scoring interfaces for Mentors and Teachers. This avoids complex weighting logic while still capturing the two essential perspectives of an internship.

#### Implementation Deep-Dive
**(Completed)**
- **Module:** Created the `Assessment` module to centralize grading logic.
- **Scoring Engine:** Implemented `AssessmentService` with automated averaging of criteria-based scores.
- **Actor Workspaces:**
    - **Teacher:** Livewire component for academic evaluation with MDL-style form.
    - **Mentor:** Simple, mobile-friendly rating interface for industry feedback.
- **Verification:** Successfully implemented and passed unit tests for the service layer and feature tests for actor components. Resolved environment-specific `SIGILL` crash by adjusting model casts from `decimal:2` to `float`.

#### Architectural Impact
Completes the core business cycle of Internara by enabling formal closure of the internship journey.

### Keystone 3: Automated PDF Reporting & Verification

#### Technical Rationale
Even with manual scoring, the output (Certificates and Transcripts) must be professional and verifiable.

#### Implementation Deep-Dive
(Pending Implementation) - Integration of a PDF service to generate standardized completion documents with QR-code verification.

#### Architectural Impact
Transforms manual entries into high-value academic artifacts, ensuring the system provides tangible value to students and the institution.
