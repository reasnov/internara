# Overview: Version v0.6.x-alpha (Assessment & Finalization)

## 1. Version Details

- **Name**: `v0.6.x-alpha`
- **Series Code**: `ARC01-FEAT-01`
- **Status**: `In Progress`
- **Current Operational Context**: Implementing a simplified, manual assessment flow that connects industry feedback with academic evaluation.

## 2. Goals & Architectural Philosophy (Pre-Production)

### Problem Analysis (The "Why")

Moving from daily tracking to final evaluation often creates a "paperwork bottleneck." Mentors in industry are busy and need a very simple way to provide feedback, while Teachers need a unified view of student performance (Attendance, Journal, and Industry Score) to provide a final academic grade. We need to replace complex automated engines with a streamlined manual workflow that minimizes friction for all users.

### Architectural Pillars (The "How")

We will implement a **Unified Assessment Module** that prioritizes ease of input. Instead of complex rules, we provide clear, predefined criteria that Mentors can grade with a few clicks. The system will then aggregate these manual inputs into a **Final Finalization Report**, reducing the administrative burden on Teachers.

### Architectural Constraints (The Rules)

Assessment forms MUST be intuitive and mobile-friendly for busy mentors. Every grade entry MUST be auditable (tracking who entered what and when). Finalization can only occur once both Industry and School portions are completed.

## 3. Production Keystones (Analytical Narrative)

### Keystone 1: Streamlined Dual-Perspective Assessment

#### Technical Rationale
To ensure a balanced evaluation without over-engineering, we will provide separate, simple scoring interfaces for Mentors and Teachers. This avoids complex weighting logic while still capturing the two essential perspectives of an internship.

#### Implementation Deep-Dive
(Pending Implementation) - Development of simple rating components and a consolidated "Score Card" for each internship registration.

#### Architectural Impact
Completes the core business cycle of Internara by enabling formal closure of the internship journey.

### Keystone 2: Automated PDF Reporting & Verification

#### Technical Rationale
Even with manual scoring, the output (Certificates and Transcripts) must be professional and verifiable.

#### Implementation Deep-Dive
(Pending Implementation) - Integration of a PDF service to generate standardized completion documents with QR-code verification.

#### Architectural Impact
Transforms manual entries into high-value academic artifacts, ensuring the system provides tangible value to students and the institution.
