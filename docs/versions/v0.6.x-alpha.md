# Overview: Version v0.6.x-alpha (ARC01-FEAT-01)

## 1. Version Details

- **Series Code**: `ARC01-FEAT-01`
- **Scope**: `Assessment & Finalization`
- **Status**: `Stable`
- **Current Operational Context**: Finalized the core internship cycle by implementing role-based 
  workspaces, unified assessment logic, and automated PDF reporting.

## 2. Goals & Architectural Philosophy

### Problem Analysis (The "Why")

Moving from daily tracking to final evaluation often creates a "paperwork bottleneck." Mentors in
industry are busy and need a very simple way to provide feedback, while Teachers need a unified view
of student performance to provide a final academic grade. The system needs to bridge the gap between 
industry feedback and academic records with zero friction.

### Architectural Pillars (The "How")

- **Workspace Decomposition**: Breaking down the monolithic dashboard into role-specific modules.
- **Service-Oriented Assessment**: Centralizing grading logic into a dedicated, domain-agnostic 
  module that serves all actors.
- **Signed Artifacts**: Generating verifiable documents (PDFs) that serve as formal proof of 
  completion.

## 3. Production Keystones (Analytical Narrative)

### Keystone 1: Role-Based Workspace Segmentation (RBAC Workspaces)

#### Technical Rationale
The central `Dashboard` module was a monolithic catch-all. By decomposing it, we reduce the 
cognitive load for each actor and allow for role-specific feature sets (e.g., Attendance for 
students, Approval for teachers).

#### Implementation Deep-Dive
- **Deprecation:** The `Dashboard` module was successfully removed.
- **New Modules:** Introduced `Admin`, `Student`, `Teacher`, and `Mentor` modules.
- **Unified Layout**: All workspaces now utilize the `ui::components.layouts.dashboard` provided 
  by the UI module, ensuring visual consistency.

### Keystone 2: Streamlined Dual-Perspective Assessment

#### Technical Rationale
Internship success is subjective. We implemented a system that captures both the industrial 
performance (Mentor) and academic alignment (Teacher).

#### Implementation Deep-Dive
- **Assessment Module:** Centralized scoring engine using `AssessmentService`.
- **Authorization**: Implemented strict ownership checks. Only assigned supervisors can grade 
  specific registrations.
- **Resilience**: Fixed a testing environment bug where `decimal` casts caused system-level crashes 
  by standardizing on `float` casts for scores.

### Keystone 3: Automated PDF Reporting & Verification

#### Technical Rationale
The value of an internship is often tied to the physical certificate. By automating this, we 
eliminate manual document drafting.

#### Implementation Deep-Dive
- **Service Integration**: Built `CertificateService` using `laravel-dompdf` and `simple-qrcode`.
- **Public Verification**: Implemented **Signed URLs** for QR code verification, allowing 
  third-parties to verify certificate authenticity without a system account.
- **UI Integration**: Added contextual download buttons to Student and Admin dashboards.

## 4. Quality Assurance & Artifact Sync

### 4.1. Verification Analysis
- **Full Test Suite**: 65 tests passed across all modules.
- **Parallel Stability**: Verified that PDF generation and QR code logic remain stable during 
  parallel execution.
- **Linting**: Applied project-wide styling standards using Laravel Pint.

### 4.2. Continuous Documentation Sync
- **Testing Guide**: Synchronized `docs/main/testing-guide.md` with the comprehensive testing 
  library.
- **Infrastructure Module**: Updated `architecture-guide.md` to formally define the `app/` 
  directory's dual role as a framework endpoint and an infrastructure module.

### 4.3. Security & Privacy Audit
- **Signed URLs**: Verified that verification links are tamper-proof and expire/invalidate 
  correctly.
- **Broken Access Control**: Remediated vulnerabilities where supervisors could assess non-assigned 
  students.

### 4.4. Roadmap Strategy (vNext)
The next iteration (**v0.7.x**) will focus on **Administrative Automation**, specifically bulk 
operations for certificate generation and batch internship status transitions.
