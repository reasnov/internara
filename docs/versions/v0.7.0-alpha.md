Assistant**. We are removing the manual headache of checking documents one by one, allowing
coordinators to manage hundreds of students with ease.

## 🚀 Key Highlights

### 1. Smart Requirement Gate

No more missing documents!

- **Automated Checks**: Students cannot proceed with their internship application until they fulfill
  all mandatory requirements (like Parental Consent or Skill Certificates).

  administratively compliant.

Grading is now faster and fairer.

- **Data-Driven**: The system automatically factors in **Attendance Rates** and **Journal
  Diligence** into the final grade.
- **Transparency**: Students and teachers can see exactly how discipline affects their final score.

### 3. Command Center

A new dashboard dedicated to heavy lifting.

- **Bulk Operations**: Monitor the progress of mass actions, like generating 500 certificates at
  once.
- **Instant Alerts**: Get notified immediately if a background process needs your attention.

## 🛠 Stability & Quality

  document types smoothly.
