Platform**. We've introduced a powerful reporting engine that synthesizes internship activities into
professional PDF documents and implemented a complete audit trail for student placements.

## ✨ Key Highlights

### 📊 Powerful Reporting Engine

You can now generate institutional reports directly from the dashboard.

- **Class Summary Reports:** Instructors can export the status of all interns in their class.
- **Partner Engagement:** Analyze which industry partners are most active and responsive.
- **History Tracking:** Keep track of all your generated reports and download them whenever needed.

### 🕵️ Traceable Placement Lifecycle

Transparency is key to a fair internship program.

- **Placement History:** Every time a student is reassigned to a new company, the system logs the
  reason and the timing.
- **Timeline UI:** Administrators can now view a student's entire journey across different
  placements in a clear, sequential timeline.

### 🧠 Smarter Analytical Dashboard

The Admin Dashboard now helps you identify students who need attention.

- **"At-Risk" Students:** Automatically flags students with low journal engagement or poor feedback
  from mentors.
- **Institutional Summary:** Get a birds-eye view of your total interns, active partners, and
  placement rates.

## 🛡️ Stability & Quality

- **Strict Modular Isolation:** We've refactored cross-module communication to adhere to our new
  **Strict Isolation Principle**, ensuring the system remains maintainable as it grows.
- **Standardized Data Scoping:** The `HasAcademicYear` logic has been unified, ensuring that your
  data remains organized across different academic periods.
- **UUID Consistency:** All database entities now strictly use UUID v4 for enhanced security and
  portability.

## 🔮 Forward Outlook

Next, we move toward **System Initialization & Mobility (v0.9.0)**:

- **Zero-Config Setup:** A new automated installation process.
- **Web Setup Wizard:** Easy first-run configuration for administrators.
- **Geo-Verified Journals:** Ensuring students are actually "on-site" when they log their daily
  activities.
