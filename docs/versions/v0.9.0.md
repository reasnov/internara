# Release Note: v0.9.0 — Easy System Setup

**Status:** Released | **Maintenance:** Snapshot

---

## 🚀 Overview

Setting up a new system shouldn't be difficult. Version **v0.9.0** focuses on reducing the effort
required to get Internara up and running. We've built an automated "Setup Wizard" that guides you
through configuring your school's identity and creating your first administrator account.

## ✨ Key Features

### 🛠️ Automated Setup Wizard

We've introduced a friendly, 8-step guide to help you initialize Internara:

- **School Identity**: Easily upload your school's logo and set your brand name.
- **Admin Account**: Set up the first system administrator during the first run.
- **Environment Check**: The system automatically checks if your server is ready to run Internara.
- **Guided Configuration**: Simple steps to set up departments and internship periods.

### 🧹 Behind-the-Scenes Improvements

While we focused on the setup experience, we also polished the core system:

- **Faster Performance**: Improved how the application starts up.
- **Better Translations**: Ensured everything in the setup process is clearly written in both
  Indonesian and English.
- **Enhanced Security**: Added new layers of protection to ensure only authorized staff can
  configure the system.

_This version makes Internara more accessible for schools and institutions, allowing you to focus on
managing internships rather than technical configuration._
