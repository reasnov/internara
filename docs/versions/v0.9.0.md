# Release Note: v0.9.0

**Series Code:** `ARC01-BOOT-01` | **Stage:** Alpha | **Status:** In Progress

> **Administrative Management** (Section 1) requirements of the
> **[Internara Specs](../../internara-specs.md)**.

## 🚀 Overview

Version **v0.9.0** focuses on reducing deployment friction. We are introducing the **Setup** module
for automated environment initialization.

---

## ✨ Features

### 🛠️ Zero-Config Initialization (`Setup` Module)

- **Automated Installer:** A new `app:install` CLI command to handle migrations, seeding, and
  environment validation.
- **Web Setup Wizard:** A first-run interface for managing institutional branding (`brand_name`,
  `brand_logo`) and initial administrator setup.
- **System/SMTP Configuration:** Guided setup for mail and system-wide configurations within the
  wizard.
- **Installer Service:** Orchestrates technical bootstrapping steps via the `InstallerService`
  contract.

### 🧹 Technical Refinement

- **ServiceProvider Standardization:** Refactored core and operational module service providers
  (`UI`, `Auth`, `Log`, `Setting`, `Assessment`) to use standardized lifecycle methods from the
  `ManagesModuleProvider` trait, reducing boilerplate and ensuring consistent boot behavior.
- **Infrastructure Hardening (Genesis Fix):** Enhanced the `ManagesModuleProvider` trait with strict
  typing and improved recursive configuration merging.
- **ESM Asset Loading:** Fixed the `vite-module-loader.js` to ensure compatibility with Node.js ES
  Modules, preventing build failures in modern environments.
- **Base Service Security:** Hardened the `EloquentQuery` base service to enforce mass-assignment
  filtering and ensure update operations strictly respect query scoping.
- **Unified Error Handling:** Centralized database exception management within the base service
  layer, reducing code redundancy and improving error traceability across all domain services.

- **Competency Mapping**: Linking journals to curriculum rubrics.
- **Mentoring Dialogue**: Formal feedback logs for Instructors/Mentors.
