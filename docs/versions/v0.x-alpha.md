# Application v0.x-alpha Overview

This document outlines the planned features and scope for the `v0.x-alpha` release of Internara. This release represents the foundational, initial development phase of the application, focusing on establishing core architectural components, essential modules, and basic functionalities. At this stage, the features are defined but not yet fully implemented or publicly released.

---

## Features and Scope

### 1. Application Auto Binding (base: 'app/Providers')
*   **Scope:** Implementation of a robust service binding and auto-discovery mechanism, primarily managed through `app/Providers/BindServiceProvider`. Key aspects include:
    *   Automated resolution of interfaces to concrete implementations based on naming conventions.
    *   Support for caching discovery results for performance.
    *   Configurable patterns for guessing implementations.
    *   Support for explicit manual and contextual bindings.
    This mechanism aims to streamline dependency injection across the application.

### 2. Core, Support and Shared Modules
*   **Scope:** Establishment of the foundational modular structure, including:
    *   **`Core` module:** Encapsulates the essential architectural building blocks and business rules specific to the Internara business domain.
    *   **`Shared` module:** Provides universal, portable components completely agnostic of Internara's specific business rules.
    *   **`Support` module:** Handles specialized integrations and abstracts infrastructure-level complexity for `Core` and domain modules.
    These modules will define the base framework for future domain-specific modules and adhere to strict portability guidelines.

### 3. Exception Management (module: `Exception`)
*   **Scope:** Implementation of a standardized, localized exception handling system using a dedicated `Exception` module. This includes custom `AppException` (for all domain-specific or business logic errors) and `RecordNotFoundException` classes. The system will ensure consistent, user-friendly error feedback and detailed, structured logging for developers.

### 4. Core UI System (module: `UI`)
*   **Scope:** Development of the foundational UI framework within a dedicated `UI` module. This encompasses:
    *   Setting up **Tailwind CSS**, **DaisyUI**, and **MaryUI** for consistent styling and component usage.
    *   Defining theming (light/dark mode support) and typography standards.
    *   Establishing core Blade and Livewire components that form the basis of the user interface.
    The `UI` module will serve as the single source of truth for all frontend assets and standards.

### 5. Application Setups (module: `Setup`)
*   **Scope:** Provision of initial setup mechanisms for the application. This includes:
    *   Automated database seeding for core roles and permissions.
    *   Basic configuration guided by environment variables (`.env`).
    This module aims to facilitate the initial deployment and streamline the configuration steps for new installations.

### 6. Application Settings (module: `Setting`)
*   **Scope:** Implementation of a basic system for managing application-wide settings. This includes:
    *   A dedicated `Setting` model for persistence.
    *   A basic administrative interface for CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on these settings.
    This module will allow key application parameters to be configured and managed centrally.

### 7. Status Services (module: `Status`)
*   **Scope:** Implementation of a generic and flexible status management service, encapsulated within a dedicated `Status` module. This service will handle various status mechanisms across different entities within the application (e.g., user status, internship registration status). Key design considerations include:
    *   Support for polymorphic relationships, allowing any Eloquent model to have associated statuses.
    *   Designed without a pivot table, relying on the polymorphic relation for status assignment.
    *   Provides standardized methods for defining, assigning, updating, and querying statuses.
    This module ensures consistency and reusability for status workflows across Internara.

### 8. Users Management (module: `User`)
*   **Scope:** Development of core user management functionalities, encompassing:
    *   User creation, viewing, updating, and deletion (CRUD operations).
    *   Defining the `User` Eloquent model and associated services.
    *   Basic UI components for user administration.
    Special consideration for using UUIDs as primary keys for publicly exposed models will be included, enhancing security against resource enumeration attacks.

### 9. Permission and Role Management (module: `Permission`)
*   **Scope:** Integration and customization of the `spatie/laravel-permission` package within a dedicated `Permission` module. This will cover:
    *   Defining granular permissions (`module.action` convention) and application-wide roles.
    *   Assigning permissions to roles.
    *   Implementing authorization checks using Laravel Policies and Gates.
    Configurable ID types (UUID/Integer) for permission models will be supported to align with the project's development conventions.

### 10. User Authentication and Authorization (module: `Auth`)
*   **Scope:** Implementation of standard user authentication processes, including:
    *   Login and logout functionalities.
    *   User registration (if applicable for alpha).
    *   Integration with the `Permission` module for basic authorization checks across the application.
    This module will leverage Laravel's built-in authentication features to ensure security and reliability.

### 11. Owner Services (module: User)
*   **Scope:** Definition and protection of the special "Owner" role, which represents a super-admin account. This includes:
    *   **Owner Registration:** Implementation of a dedicated process for the initial registration and setup of the primary owner account, ensuring it's a one-time operation.
    *   Ensuring the owner account cannot be accidentally deleted or have its role changed.
    *   Implementing implicit "grant all" authority for the owner via Laravel Gates.
    This feature is crucial for maintaining ultimate administrative control and system integrity.

### 12. School Profile and Configuration (module: `School`)
*   **Scope:** Development of features for managing school-specific profiles and configurations. This module will enable:
    *   Defining school details (e.g., name, address, contact information).
    *   Configuring settings related to internship programs for that school.
    This provides a foundational structure for multi-school or institutional management.

### 13. Departments Management (module: `Department`)
*   **Scope:** Implementation of CRUD operations for managing academic or organizational departments within a school. This includes:
    *   Defining the `Department` Eloquent model.
    *   Associated services for business logic.
    *   Basic UI for creating, listing, updating, and deleting department entries.

### 14. Internship Management (module: `Internship`)
*   **Scope:** Development of the core functionalities for managing internship programs. This will include:
    *   Defining internship-related models (e.g., `Internship`, `InternshipPeriod`, `InternshipType`).
    *   Basic CRUD operations for creating, listing, viewing, and modifying internship opportunities.
    *   Initial mechanisms for student assignment to internships or application processes.

### 15. System and User Notifications (module: `Notification`)
*   **Scope:** Implementation of a basic notification system, allowing the application to send system-generated notifications to users. This will encompass:
    *   Integration with Laravel's notification features (e.g., mail notifications).
    *   Defining notification types and templates.
    This module provides essential communication channels within the application.

### 16. System Monitor and User Activity Log (module: `Log`)
*   **Scope:** Development of a robust logging system to monitor system events and user activities, primarily utilizing the `spatie/laravel-activitylog` package. This includes:
    *   Tracking important actions performed by users (e.g., login, record changes).
    *   Logging system errors and warnings.
    This module provides a foundational layer for auditing, debugging, and understanding application usage. A detailed guide for its integration can be found in the **[Spatie Laravel Activitylog Integration](main/packages/spatie-laravel-activitylog.md)** documentation.
