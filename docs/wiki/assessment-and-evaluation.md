## 1. Automated Compliance Scoring
Internara removes the manual labor of calculating participation rates by analyzing the 
system's "Pulse" data.

- **Metrics**:
    - **Attendance Score**: Calculated based on check-in consistency and excused permits.
    - **Logbook Compliance**: Derived from the ratio of approved daily journals vs. the total 
      required days.
- **Why?**: Automated scoring ensures fairness and eliminates human error in high-volume 
  evaluations (**S2 - Sustain**).

## 2. Multi-Sourced Performance Rubrics
A student's grade is not just about presence; it's about the quality of their work.

- **Action**: Both the **Monitoring Teacher** and the **Industry Mentor** submit specialized 
  rubrics.
- **Checklist**:
    - [ ] **Soft Skills**: Evaluation of discipline, teamwork, and communication.
    - [ ] **Technical Skills**: Assessment of mastered competencies specific to the 
      department.
- **Why?**: This **Dual Perspective** provides a holistic view of the student's 
  readiness for the industry.

## 3. Final Certification & Reporting
Once evaluations are finalized, the system generates the "Output" of the entire program.

- **Action**: Navigate to **Final Grades**.
- **Certification Checklist**:
    - [ ] Review the **Composite Grade**.
    - [ ] **Generate PDF**: Print the authoritative **Competency Achievement Report**.
- **Security Check**:
    - [ ] Every certificate includes a **Verification QR Code** linked to a signed URL.
- **Why?**: Official PDF outputs satisfy institutional compliance and provide students with 
  verifiable proof of their industrial experience (**S1 - Secure**).
