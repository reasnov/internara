# Daily Monitoring (Step Seven)

This is the "Pulse" of the internship. Step Six is the most active phase, where Internara captures
high-fidelity evidence of student progress in the field through a mobile-first monitoring loop.

## 1. The Daily Learning Evidence (Journals)

Student journals are more than just logs; they are the authoritative record of competency
attainment.

- **Process**:
    - **Student**: Records daily activities and tags mastered competencies via their dashboard.
    - **Mentor**: Validates the entry, confirming that the activity occurred as described.
    - **Teacher**: Reviews the quality of reflections and monitors competency coverage.
- **Why?**: This **Triple-Check** mechanism ensures that every journal entry is verified by both the
  field supervisor and the academic supervisor (**S1 - Secure**).

## 2. Presence Tracking (Mobile Attendance)

Internara replaces manual signature sheets with a digital attendance system.

- **Process**:
    - **Check-in/Out**: Students perform daily attendance actions using their smartphones.
    - **Verification**: Mentors can view real-time presence logs to confirm student availability at
      the partner site.
- **Monitoring Checklist**:
    - [ ] **Absence Tracking**: Instructors can identify students who haven't logged in for more
          than 48 hours.
    - [ ] **Leave Requests**: Students can submit digital permits for medical or official absences.
- **Why?**: Real-time tracking allows for immediate intervention if a student is absent without
  cause, preserving the institutional reputation (**S2 - Sustain**).

## 3. Official Mentoring & Supervision

Instructors use Internara to document their periodic field visits and guidance sessions.

- **Action**: Navigate to **Mentoring Logs**.
- **Checklist**:
    - [ ] Record the date and content of the site visit.
    - [ ] Upload evidence (photos or signed visit forms) if required.
- **Why?**: Mentoring logs provide the necessary "Paper Trail" for institutional compliance audits
  and satisfy supervisory requirements (**S2 - Sustain**).
