# Step Five: Enrollment & Matching

This is the "Coupling" phase. Internara connects the three pillars of a successful internship: the
**Student**, the **Academic Supervisor** (Teacher), and the **Industrial Partner** (Mentor). Proper
matching ensures that every field activity is traceable and supervised.

## 1. The Enrollment Loop

Students must be "Approved" for an internship program before they can be matched to a slot.

- **Action**: Navigate to **Internship Registrations**.
- **Checklist**:
    - [ ] Review student applications for program eligibility.
    - [ ] **Verify Prerequisites**: Ensure the student has fulfilled any administrative
          requirements.
    - [ ] **Approve Enrollment**: Transition the status to "Approved".
- **Why?**: Verification acts as a **Compliance Gate** (**S1 - Secure**), ensuring only authorized
  students consume institutional placement quotas.

## 2. Building the Supervisory Triangle

This is the core administrative act of Internara. You must pair the approved student with their
supervisory team.

- **Action**: Navigate to **Placements** -> **Matchings**.
- **Matching Checklist**:
    - [ ] **Student**: Select an approved student.
    - [ ] **Partner**: Select an available placement slot.
    - [ ] **Monitoring Teacher**: Assign an Instructor from the student's department.
    - [ ] **Industry Mentor**: Assign the supervisor from the host company.
- **Why?**: This "Supervisory Triangle" enables the **Dual Validation** model. Both supervisors will
  receive access to the student's daily journals and attendance logs automatically (**S3 -
  Scalable**).

## 3. Activation & Field Readiness

Once matched, the student's internship becomes "Active" on their official Start Date.

- **Action**: Instruct all parties to log in and verify their "Active Placements" dashboard.
- **Why?**: Internara automatically provisions the correct permissions to the Teacher and Mentor
  based on this match, ensuring zero-configuration access control (**S1 - Secure**).
