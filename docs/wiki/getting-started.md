# Getting Started: Administrative Onboarding

This guide provides the first steps for administrators to begin using the Internara system
effectively after a successful installation.

---

## 1. Initial Access

1.  **URL**: Access your installation via the primary domain (e.g., `http://localhost:8000`).
2.  **Credentials**: Log in using the administrator account created during the **Setup Wizard**.
3.  **Dashboard**: You will be greeted by the **Global Command Center**, providing real-time
    telemetry on student participation and system health.

---

## 2. The Configuration Sequence

To ensure the system is ready for the academic cycle, follow this priority sequence:

### Step 1: Institutional Branding

Navigate to **School Management** and verify your institution's identity. This data is used for
official document synthesis and UI branding.

### Step 2: Academic Structure

Define your **Departments** (Specializations). Every student and teacher must be associated with a
department to ensure modular isolation and correct supervision.

### Step 3: Global Settings

Access **System Settings** to configure:

- **Active Academic Year**: The temporal scope for current operations.
- **Participation Thresholds**: Thresholds for late attendance and journal submission windows.

## 3. Populating the Human Resource Base

Before launching an internship program, you must register the primary stakeholders:

1.  **Instructors (Teachers)**: Register academic supervisors who will monitor student progress.
2.  **Students**: Import or register the student cohort for the upcoming period.
3.  **Partners (Mentors)**: Register industry partners and their respective on-site supervisors.
