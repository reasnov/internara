# Phase 2: Institutional Setup (Step Four)

After completing the **Setup Wizard**, Internara is technically "live," but it remains a blank
canvas. Step Two is about claiming the system for your institution and defining the academic
structure that will govern all future internship cycles.

## 1. Establishing Institutional Identity

Your first priority is to transition the system from "Internara" (Product Identity) to your specific
school (Instance Identity).

- **Action**: Navigate to **School Management** (or `System Settings` -> `Branding`).
- **Identity Checklist**:
    - [ ] **Brand Name**: Change the display name from "Internara" to your school's full official
          name (e.g., "SMK Negeri 1 Jakarta").
    - [ ] **Institutional Logo**: Upload a high-resolution version of your school's emblem.
    - [ ] **Legal Metadata**: Ensure the NPSN and official address are accurate for reports.
- **Why?**: This data satisfies **[SYRS-C-004]**, ensuring all certificates and PDF reports
  generated by the system carry authoritative institutional weight.

## 2. Defining the Academic Structure

Internara cannot manage students without "Departments" (Jurusan). These act as the primary
organizational containers for both Students and Teachers.

- **Action**: Navigate to **Departments**.
- **Structural Checklist**:
    - [ ] Register all active **Program Keahlian** (e.g., Software Engineering, Accounting).
    - [ ] Assign a **Head of Department** (optional at this stage, but recommended).
- **Why?**: Grouping stakeholders by department ensures that supervision is relevant and that
  analytics are segmented correctly for institutional evaluation.

## 3. Activating Temporal Scoping

Internara uses **Strict Temporal Scoping**. Every journal entry and attendance log is automatically
linked to an **Academic Year**.

- **Action**: Navigate to **System Settings** -> **Academic Year**.
- **Time Checklist**:
    - [ ] Verify the **Active Year** (e.g., "2025/2026").
    - [ ] Set the current **Semester** (Odd/Even).
- **Why?**: Correct scoping prevents data drift. Without an active year, the system will restrict
  students from logging activities to preserve data integrity (**S1 - Secure**).
