# Phase 3: Program Preparation (Step Five)

Before any student can step into the field, you must define the "Rules of Engagement." Step Four is
about establishing the temporal boundaries and industrial connections required for an internship
cycle to exist.

## 1. Defining the Internship Cycle

Every internship belongs to a specific window of time. This prevents students from logging data
outside of official periods.

- **Action**: Navigate to **Internship Programs**.
- **Checklist**:
    - [ ] **Name the Program**: (e.g., "PKL Industri Semester Genap").
    - [ ] **Set Dates**: Define the official **Start Date** and **End Date**.
    - [ ] **Verify Academic Year**: Ensure it is linked to the correct institutional cycle.
- **Why?**: The system uses these dates as a **Temporal Guard** (**S1 - Secure**), automatically
  enabling or disabling journal entries based on the current date.

## 2. Managing the Partner Ecosystem

You must register the companies and agencies that act as industrial hosts.

- **Action**: Navigate to **Industry Partners** (Companies).
- **Checklist**:
    - [ ] Register the full name and address of the host organization.
    - [ ] Identify the **Industry Supervisor (Mentor)** for each partner.
- **Why?**: These partners form the "External Domain." Their records are required to generate
  Placement Slots and final certificates of competency.

## 3. Allocating Placement Slots (Quotas)

This is where you bridge school departments with industrial partners.

- **Action**: Navigate to **Placements**.
- **Checklist**:
    - [ ] Select a Partner and link them to a specific **Department**.
    - [ ] **Define Quota**: Specify how many students can be placed in this slot.
- **Why?**: Allocation ensures that students are only placed in companies that align with their
  specific specialization, preventing "Spaghetti Placements" and ensuring relevant mentoring (**S3 -
  Scalable**).
