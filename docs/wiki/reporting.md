# Intelligence & Reporting (Step Nine) Internara doesn't just collect data; it transforms it into

institutional intelligence. This guide helps you navigate the reporting engine and understand the
analytical metrics provided by the **Admin** and **Report** modules.

## 1. Institutional Dashboards

Administrators have access to the **Intelligence Dashboard**, a real-time synthesis of engagement
and performance metrics.

- **Checklist for Monitoring**:
    - [ ] **Attendance Rate**: Monitor the "Pulse" of the program across all departments.
    - [ ] **Journal Compliance**: Identify gaps in student reflections and mentor validation.
    - [ ] **"At-Risk" Identification**: Proactively intervene when students fall below 75%
          engagement or receive negative field feedback.
- **Why?**: Real-time intelligence ensures that no student is "lost" in the field, satisfying the
  mandate for continuous institutional oversight (**S2 - Sustain**).

## 2. Generating Authoritative Reports

Internara allows you to export high-fidelity PDF documents for official records.

- **Report Checklist**:
    - [ ] **Competency Achievement**: Print the final transcript for each student.
    - [ ] **Class Summary**: Export aggregated progress for instructors and heads of department.
    - [ ] **Partner Analytics**: Analyze which industrial partners provide the best learning
          outcomes.
- **Performance Note**: Heavy reports are generated in the **Background**. You will receive a
  notification and a secure download link once the file is ready.

## 3. Interpreting the Composite Metrics

The system uses a standardized calculation model to ensure evaluation fairness:

- **Participation Score**: A weighted calculation representing the student's operational discipline
  (Attendance + Journaling).
- **Final Grade**: A composite score involving evaluations from both the **Monitoring Teacher** and
  the **Industry Mentor**.
