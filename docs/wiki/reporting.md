# Intelligence & Reporting Guide

This guide explains how to utilize Internara's reporting engine and analytical dashboards to monitor
and evaluate internship programs.

## 1. Institutional Dashboards

Administrators and Staff members have access to the **Intelligence Dashboard**, which provides a
real-time synthesis of engagement and performance metrics.

### 1.1 Engagement Metrics
- **Attendance Rate**: The percentage of students checking in consistently.
- **Journal Compliance**: The percentage of approved daily logs relative to the total internship duration.

### 1.2 "At-Risk" Identification
The system automatically flags students who meet the following criteria:
- Attendance falls below 75%.
- Journal submissions are overdue by more than 7 days.
- Negative feedback from industry supervisors.

## 2. Generating Reports

Internara allows stakeholders to export data into professional PDF documents.

### 2.1 Report Types
- **Competency Achievement**: A detailed transcript of skills acquired by a student during their placement.
- **Class Summary**: An aggregated report for instructors to see the progress of an entire cohort.
- **Partner Engagement**: Analysis of industry placement utilization and mentor feedback.

### 2.2 Asynchronous Generation
Heavy reports are generated in the background. Once you start a report:
1.  You will receive a notification that the process has started.
2.  You can continue using the application.
3.  A download link will be sent to your **Notifications** and **Email** once ready.

## 3. Interpreting Results

- **Participation Score**: A weighted calculation (50% Attendance, 50% Journaling) representing the student's operational commitment.
- **Final Grade**: A composite score involving evaluations from both Teachers (40%) and Mentors (40%), plus Participation (20%).
