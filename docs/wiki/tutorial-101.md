# Internara 101: The Complete Operational Journey

This tutorial provides a step-by-step roadmap for administrators to manage a complete internship
lifecycle—from institutional setup to final student evaluation.

---

## Phase 1: Foundational Configuration

After the **Setup Wizard** is complete, you must ensure the institutional foundation is solid.

### 1.1 Institutional Identity
- **Navigation**: `School Management`
- **Action**: Verify your school's name, logo, and legal details.
- **Why?**: This data appears on every official certificate and report generated by the system.

### 1.2 Academic Specializations
- **Navigation**: `Departments`
- **Action**: Create departments (e.g., "Software Engineering", "Accounting").
- **Why?**: Students and Instructors must be grouped by department for effective supervision.

### 1.3 Active Period
- **Navigation**: `System Settings` -> `Academic Year`
- **Action**: Set the **Active Academic Year** and **Semester**.
- **Why?**: Internara scopes all data (Journals, Attendance) to the active period to prevent overlap
  with previous years.

---

## Phase 2: Preparing the Human Resources

### 2.1 Registering Supervisors
- **Navigation**: `User Management` -> `Add Teacher`
- **Action**: Register your teaching staff and assign them to their respective departments.
- **Why?**: Only registered teachers can be assigned as **Instructors** for students.

### 2.2 Onboarding Students
- **Navigation**: `User Management` -> `Add Student` (or use Excel Import)
- **Action**: Register the student cohort for the upcoming internship period.
- **Why?**: Students need accounts to log their daily activities.

---

## Phase 3: Launching the Internship Program

### 3.1 Defining the Program
- **Navigation**: `Internship` -> `Programs` -> `Create`
- **Action**: Define the internship window (Start & End dates) and the target academic year.
- **Why?**: This acts as the "container" for all registrations.

### 3.2 Placement Management
- **Navigation**: `Internship` -> `Companies` & `Placements`
- **Action**: Register industry partners and the number of available slots for students.

---

## Phase 4: Registration & Matching

### 4.1 Student Registration
- **Student Action**: Students log in and register for an available program.
- **Staff Action**: Approve registrations and verify that students have met institutional
  requirements (e.g., submitted health forms).

### 4.2 Official Placement
- **Navigation**: `Internship` -> `Placements` -> `Assign Student`
- **Action**: Match a student to a specific company and assign an **Instructor** (Teacher) and a
  **Mentor** (Industry Supervisor).

---

## Phase 5: The Daily Monitoring Loop

This is the high-frequency phase where the system captures evidence of learning.

1.  **Daily Log**: Students submit **Journal Entries** and claim competencies.
2.  **Attendance**: Students perform **Check-in/out** via their mobile devices.
3.  **Verification**:
    - **Mentors** validate logs and provide behavioral feedback.
    - **Instructors** monitor progress through the **Supervision Dashboard**.

---

## Phase 6: Assessment & Evaluation

As the internship window closes, the system aggregates telemetry for final grading.

### 6.1 Performance Evaluation
- **Action**: Instructors and Mentors submit their respective evaluation rubrics.
- **System Action**: Internara automatically calculates the **Participation Score** (Attendance +
  Journaling).

### 6.2 Final Certification
- **Navigation**: `Assessment` -> `Final Grades`
- **Action**: Review the composite score and generate the **Competency Achievement Report** (PDF).

---

## Phase 7: Archive & Reset

### 7.1 Data Archiving
- **Action**: Export the final cohort reports for institutional records.

### 7.2 Preparing the Next Cycle
- **Action**: Update the **Active Academic Year** in settings to begin the process anew.
