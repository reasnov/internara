# User Onboarding: Teachers and Students

With the foundation set, you must register the individuals who will participate in the internship
cycle.

---

## 1. Registering Instructors (Teachers)
- **Navigation**: `User Management` -> `Add Teacher`
- **Action**: Create accounts for your teaching staff and assign them to their departments.
- **Why?**: Only registered teachers can be assigned as supervisors for students.

## 2. Onboarding the Student Cohort
- **Navigation**: `User Management` -> `Add Student`
- **Options**:
    - **Single**: Add students one by one for small groups.
    - **Mass Import**: Use the Excel/CSV template to register an entire class at once.
- **Why?**: Students need active accounts to log their internship journey.
